I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have with me today a couple of guests, Ryan Welcher and Mario Santos, who have joined me to talk about the Interactivity API. This is an API that we&#8217;ve been working on for quite a while, and it&#8217;s a fascinating thing. It&#8217;s really specifically user-facing in its functionality but makes a lot of work streamlined for everyday developers, whether you are building something for yourself, for your family, or for a client. This whole project probably is gonna really speak to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hi, guys, and welcome to the show. First-time guests, both of you. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:15] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yes. First time for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:17] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thanks for inviting us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Well, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, like your name, what you do with WordPress, how you contribute to the project, something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I can go first. My name is Ryan Welcher. I&#8217;m a developer advocate and sponsored by Automattic. Then, I contribute full-time to the WordPress project by creating documentation, doing live streams, creating videos, and just generally trying to be helpful in in the space to help engineers and extenders work with the various APIs in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love the just generally trying to be helpful part. Mario, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:52] <strong>Mario:</strong> He really is. He really does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:55] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m Mario Santos. I&#8217;m also a sponsored contributor, and I&#8217;m more focused on the project management and developer. I consider myself a mix of both. Right now I&#8217;m working on projects that are focused on improving the developer experience especially. That can go from the Block API to the Interactivity API; that is the topic today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Very nice. Very nice. Just lots of helping that everyone&#8217;s trying to do. I think that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;re talking about the Interactivity API today. And, Mario, I believe it was almost a year ago that you first put this proposal out into the WordPress project. Do you wanna tell us a little bit about just, like, where the idea of this came from? Like, I know it wasn&#8217;t originally called the Interactivity API, but, like, what was you said you do some a bit of product, a bit of development. Like, what was it about this idea that was so important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:48] <strong>Mario:</strong> Yeah. Sure. So, basically, well, the proposal came, like, one year ago, but it has been in the works, like, for many years, I would say. Just to give a bit more context, previously, before being a sponsored contributor, I was working at a startup called Frontity Framework, and we were building a React framework to enable rich user experiences on top of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So basically, it was a framework for headless WordPress. And at some point, we became sponsored contributors, the idea was to bring those user experiences to those rich and cool websites that lead to WordPress. So, you don&#8217;t need an external framework to create them, and you can do that directly in WordPress. So that&#8217;s where the idea of the Interactivity API comes from. From there, we started exploring different possibilities and tailoring it more to WordPress to ensure it works with its APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think after many many months working on that, the Interactivity API is the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I just wanted to note that you started that answer with, like, the proposal was about a year ago, but the work had been happening for a long time. I think that&#8217;s generally true, and it&#8217;s not something that we always really acknowledge. This happens with patents also. This is going to be a strange tangent, but this is how we do in in my brain. This is how my brain works. So frequently, you&#8217;ll see a brand new product, but the patent for it was, like, 30 years beforehand, like, way before you ever see anything. And I think that&#8217;s kinda how this works also with software development. Like, the idea, has been going for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The problem was identified a long time ago. And by the time you see something that helps to solve the problem or bring a new set of features to you, like, you didn&#8217;t know, but it had been being worked on for, like, five years or something. And I think that&#8217;s such a fascinating thing. That&#8217;s always apparent to me, but I think it&#8217;s not really apparent for a lot of people in the, in I don&#8217;t know, who use software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna say in the space, quote, unquote, but that&#8217;s not even it. Like, it&#8217;s the people who are using software. We don&#8217;t know how long anything&#8217;s been under development. We just know that at some point, a magical thing appeared, and we get to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So speaking of the problems that we have identified that we&#8217;re trying to solve with this. Like, was there an inherent problem that you all were trying to solve as you were coming up with this idea around the Interactivity API itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:16] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say that trying to summarize it, it covers many things, but the main problem was that creating those kinds of interactions in the client was kind of difficult. You had to manage many things many tools, and each developer could come up with different solutions, and maybe they don&#8217;t combine well together. So, the idea is to provide an extended way so developers don&#8217;t have to take care of many things. They just have to take care of the interactions they wanna create. And ensuring that it works well with the WordPress way, it works well with the block system, and any block created with this Interactivity API can communicate with each other. You can combine those blocks, and you are not gonna encounter any problem. So, I would say that the main issue we were trying to solve is that there wasn&#8217;t a standard solution. There were different approaches taken by different developers, and that could create some issues. So, until now, Gutenberg has been mainly focused on the editor side and how blocks are created. And this is a first attempt to to cover the part of the front end, the interactions that users may want to create in the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] <strong>Ryan:</strong> It solves a ton of problems. But, I mean, coming from someone like, I have a fair amount of agency experience. I&#8217;ve been, you know, you&#8217;re working on large projects. And every time someone solves a problem, they solve it slightly differently. And that&#8217;s problematic because you switch teams or, you know, someone else picks up the code base, and all of a sudden, now they have to learn your custom system that&#8217;s slightly different from the one that I built last week and the one that, you know, someone else built two weeks earlier. And this takes the guesswork out. It takes the sort of the plumbing out of the equation. One of the reasons I really loves working with WordPress when I started working with WordPress was that when I was building for clients, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building the CMS. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building a menu system or figuring out how to handle media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:10] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I just had to do the things that that client was paying me to do. Like, I just had to make their site look the way that they wanted it to. And with the Interactivity API, I think there&#8217;s a bit of that where I don&#8217;t have to worry about figuring out how am I gonna get all these pieces to talk to each other on the front end. It&#8217;s all there. I just have to connect the dots, and it makes it very, very simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m building the site right now for a workshop that I&#8217;m gonna be giving a WordCamp Asia, which is a a shameless plug. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Coming up so fast, y&#8217;all. WordCamp Asia is, like, two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I&#8217;m so excited. I have so much work to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve built an entire voting system on a website where people can pick what we&#8217;re going to be talking about in my workshop, and I built it in the Interactivity API, and it took me, you know, probably five hours. And that&#8217;s me trying to learn some things and mess around with it. And to do that without the Interactivity API would have probably been an entire React-based, you know, completely outside of WordPress. I would have loaded one thing on the page and had it build out my whole application, and now I&#8217;m doing it with blocks and I&#8217;m doing it with a block theme. So if I wanna move those blocks around. I can move the blocks around. I can change anything that I wanna change inside of WordPress the way I would normally, and all that in interactivity just still works. And that&#8217;s It&#8217;s awesome. I just I love it. I can&#8217;t like, the Interactivity API, not my website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But also both. Like, it can be both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> I wanted to say that I think it&#8217;s a great point. I like to think about it like having the best of both worlds. Right now, we have modern frameworks like React, Vue that are used to create these cool websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the Interactivity API plus WordPress brings everything together. Like, you can create those cool user experiences while keeping the full power of WordPress, its management system, the Block editor, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything like that out there. Like having the best of both both worlds because we are still working with blocks, and that&#8217;s amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Given that it&#8217;s still, it&#8217;s not even been released yet. Like, it&#8217;s coming very soon. But.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. This is all still in the Gutenberg plugin. So, like, if you don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, get the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> But just how mature the API is now, considering it is still kind of not even fully released, it&#8217;s only gonna get better? I just think it&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, kudos to Mario and your team for doing all this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you. Kudos to everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, I&#8217;ve a question that I think probably, Ryan, you can start with, but then also probably, Mario, you&#8217;re gonna have some opinions on also. In this conversation so far, we&#8217;ve done a lot of, like, when you want to have these interactions and also when you want to have these cool experiences. For folks who actually do not know what the Interactivity API is yet, and they don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about when we say these interactions like, what exactly are we talking about from a user perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, what types of things will users be able to see when they are experiencing the Interactivity API&#8217;s features and functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a great question. From a user standpoint, it&#8217;ll just look like your regular website, I think. Depending on what you&#8217;re doing. So, like the interactions that we&#8217;re talking about is when you&#8217;re in the browser and you wanna click a button and expand something, for example, or you wanna click an image and have the lightbox pop-up, which is in core now, that&#8217;s driven by the Interactivity API, but these interactions are basically when a user wants to interact with something, what it does. That&#8217;s a really generic way of saying it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Our current favorite example and, Ryan, it sounds like you also have another example. But our current favorite example is like a movie collection site, you know? And so, like, when we&#8217;re talking about what the Interactivity API is going to power, it&#8217;s things like, when you favorite a series of movies, and then you can, and it just updates that on the fly, and you&#8217;ll be able to in essentially real-time as instant as reasonably possible based on your computer and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like, then look at your list of things that you favorited or things like that. Like, for folks who don&#8217;t understand interactive site like, all of us know that that, like, if you get on a site, you have interacted with it. But when we&#8217;re talking about Interactivity API, we&#8217;re talking about types of direct actions users can take. Right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:19] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are just only triggered by some actions. It could be scrolling, clicking, or, or whatever. But, it can go from a simple example like drop down or a popover to more complex things like the movies demo, where you can navigate and the page is not reloading, and that allows you to play a trailer. It starts in a pop-up, and you can keep navigating through different pages, and the trailer keeps playing without reloading. Another example could be instant search; like you start typing the search, and it directly updates the list of films, in this case, that are shown, those kinds of things that happen In the browser. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And Ryan said you, you said that you, like, built a whole survey system, A whole polling system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah, a voting system. So there&#8217;s a series of buttons, each one representing a certain topic, and people can vote, and it tallies the amount. So each, I&#8217;m calling them recipes, has amount of time associated with it, and then so you vote until you run out of time, at which point, like in its tracking it all, and it&#8217;s showing you how much time you voted, how much is left, and once you&#8217;ve run out of time it blurs like it disables all of the voting buttons so you can&#8217;t add more because you run out of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So if you remove one, you can add again. It&#8217;s very, very powerful. And, like, before the Interactivity API, you would have to have, I would have built that whole thing in React, and it would have been one single application that just get loaded on a page. And I just think it&#8217;s amazing. And, like the, the ability to create what are called, like, single page applications or what have always sort of been called SPAs or single page applications where you&#8217;re not reloading the browser every single time you click on a link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to do some things to make that work, but that&#8217;s just available to you and in WordPress. That&#8217;s amazing. I just think that&#8217;s so neat. I mean, it&#8217;s already powering things like the Query Loop block has the ability to move pagination without reloading the page, which is, sounds like a sort of a like a okay, great, like sort of, you know, mundane thing but imagine you had two or three different query loops sitting on your homepage and you wanted to be able to paginate through each one and not refresh the page. That&#8217;s a fantastic user experience that now is just enabled and otherwise was not possible prior to the Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I feel like the Query Loop block was, like, a three-year project four years ago. And I had forgotten about it, which is surprising because I was so concerned with it when we were working directly on it all the time. But yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly the kind of example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve talked about kind of the user thing and people who are gonna build stuff for clients. But, like, if you&#8217;re a contributor and you want to figure out more about either how to use this or how to expand on what is already there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We already talked about how it&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. It&#8217;s kind of experimental over there. But, like, do you all have like, good first bugs? Things that can be worked on in there? Or is there, like, an experiment zone where people can just be like, this is what I tried with the Interactivity API until it broke? How do people work with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would like to clarify first, it&#8217;s right now, it&#8217;s private in, it&#8217;s a private API in WordPress core in 6.4, And it&#8217;s public in Gutenberg, but it&#8217;s gonna be a public API already in WordPress 6.5. So, yes. Anyone can start testing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to get involved is first sharing what interactions you want to see. I mean, everyone has different ideas, and we will love to know the interactions that people want to create using the Interactivity API, so that would be the first step. Then, test it, create your own blocks or site, and send feedback what do you like what you don&#8217;t like. Raise issues, and for that, we are mainly using GitHub. We created a new category in GitHub in the Gutenberg plugin discussions, and we try to to keep everything there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So if you have any questions any feedback, you can share it there. You can also find more discussions about the road map, the change log, many things that are going on right now. And, yeah, I would say those are the ways of getting involved, and I can also expect, maybe Ryan can tell you more here, to start working more on tutorials or videos or whatever. And for me, personally, I would love to see the community working on that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:43] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah. I can, yeah. I think that from a contributor standpoint, especially those who are trying to get into contributing, because, I mean, it&#8217;s not not complicated. Let&#8217;s put it that way, like the Interactivity API. And that&#8217;s not meaning to be a barrier to anyone, but a great place to start is documentation. A great place to start is going through those docs and making sure they&#8217;re up to date and, you know, saying, oh, well, that&#8217;s supposed to do this, so let me go try that. And if it works, great. If it doesn&#8217;t, you know, file a bug, update the documentation, that&#8217;s a great way to get started. It&#8217;s gonna familiarize yourself with the code base and what it&#8217;s supposed to do. And then, sort of, just through osmosis, you&#8217;ll start to pick up more about it. And for anyone starting to contribute to the WordPress project in general, I would say starting with documentation or unit testing is a really, really great way to kinda, dip your toe in the water and not feel too frustrated. And tutorials and demos and show us what you&#8217;re building. We wanna see it. I mean, send it to me, and I will show everyone that I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I mean, we wanna see what what people are building with it and because, you know, just like WordPress, I always use this example, but, like, people used to hack WordPress until we got a hook added for that particular thing that they were adding. So, if we don&#8217;t know what people are building or wanting to build with it, we can&#8217;t make those things happen. So knowing what people are building, how they&#8217;re building, and what they can&#8217;t build, what they&#8217;re running into, what issues they&#8217;re running into is the best way to contribute. So, so people smarter than me can build it for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that call out, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, you know, the theory of tech adoption. And for things like the Interactivity API where we&#8217;re still kind of in the early adopter phase like, Ryan, you&#8217;re an early adopter. You&#8217;re doing everything you think you want to be able to do until it breaks. And, like, I love, like, test it till it fails as a concept of how to get involved in something because, like, you&#8217;re just experimenting, and we encourage experimentation in open source and in open source software and certainly in WordPress. And so, like, it is an unusual thing to think of, like, the best way that I can give back to this project, that I can contribute to this project and make sure that it continues to succeed long term is by using it until the wheels fall off and then tell people what made the wheels fall off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that is a change in thought, But you&#8217;re right. Like, it&#8217;s a very old school open source idea to just get in there and see where it breaks, and tell us. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all we need. And I love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But I just passed my 9-year anniversary being a sponsored contributor, and I was in WordPress for a little bit before it. And so, like, I&#8217;m officially the old guard of us, and so the fact that I&#8217;m, like, so excited about the fact that people are gonna come in and break Mario&#8217;s stuff. Mario, don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s how it works. But also, like, I do find that very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:31] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m willing to see how people break things; that&#8217;s what we need. I totally agree with your reasoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. So I do have kind of, just, like, a final question for y&#8217;all. If there were one thing that you wanted the people who are listening to the WordPress Briefing to know about the Interactivity API, like a hidden gem, a little secret trick. Like, what would it be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] <strong>Mario:</strong> For me, the most exciting part of the Interactivity API is the functionality the client-side navigation enables because there are many, many things there. And I&#8217;m sure that there are many things we haven&#8217;t thought about yet, and the community will come up with some ideas and that would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:17] <strong>Ryan:</strong> For me, the thing is, I love how integrated it is with WordPress, and I know a lot of thought has gone into that without getting too into the weeds. The reasons the decisions that were made were made was so all the hooks and filters and all that goodness that we&#8217;ve had for 20 years is still gonna work. And with the HTML API, the tag processor stuff that&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, it&#8217;s just so cool. It works so well with WordPress. It just works and that&#8217;s probably it for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I work with it, I&#8217;m not having to do any weird janky filtering or stuff that, like, you know, the things that I want to do are not hindered by the Interactivity API. The rather, I&#8217;m able to do more things because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> I prefer Ryan&#8217;s answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:00] <strong>Mario:</strong> It&#8217;s something really important and it&#8217;s something we usually take for granted that it just works with WordPress APIs and the Block Editor, but if you think more about it, it&#8217;s amazing. Like, It&#8217;s what makes it really powerful, I I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For what it&#8217;s worth, I think that&#8217;s true for a lot of, like, the R&amp;D type things that we&#8217;re working on in the project right now. Right? Across Our ecosystem, like WP Playground. It is mind-boggling how progressive that is as a concept, and we currently have, like, you know, 25 ideas about what we could do with it, and we&#8217;re currently working on, like, five because we&#8217;ve got two and a half developers on it or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, like, the expectation that it will just work is there for everybody who has, is not part of the R&amp;D process, but for everyone else who&#8217;s, like, been watching its development over time, shocking. Shocking that it works at all. Not because it wasn&#8217;t supposed to work, but because, like, if someone had asked you five years ago if it was gonna be possible to run WordPress development environments locally and then also just export it and import it into whatever host you want. Like, without a host, without a server, we would all think that you were nuts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:22] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Amazing what&#8217;s happening there and, like, some of the things that we&#8217;re seeing, people who are, like, researching with AI in the WordPress space doing? Equally shocking. All of these things. Like, had you said anything to me about it five years ago, I&#8217;d be like, well, that is a mystery. So, every once in a while, I do have wild ideas about things that I wish we could do with our software. And so yesterday, I went and looked at a prototype for something that someone built based on a wish that I had in 2019. In 2019, I was like, you can play Skyrim on an Amazon Dot using just your voice. So like, why can&#8217;t we build a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then in 2021, someone prototyped that for me. It was ridiculous. It was very bad. It was hilarious. But, also, like, it took 35 minutes to create a &#8216;Hello world&#8217; page, which was ridiculous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, like, what we&#8217;re looking at, the research that I keep seeing from that AI space is people saying, like, I&#8217;m gonna put in a plain text prompt. I need a website as a yoga instructor who also makes custom hats. Right? And then, like, poof. You have this thing that kinda looks like a website with your basic functions and features using the blocks that we have created for WordPress. Like it&#8217;s fascinating how far it&#8217;s come. And that&#8217;s in 2021. It was literally impossible the last time that I was talking about it with anyone, equally literally impossible. Everyone&#8217;s like, plain language prompts for stuff, like that is just a pipe dream. Get away from us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I keep seeing, like, these demos of the research, and it&#8217;s not as far away as we all thought it was. For all these things, Playground, Interactivity API, The AI research is being done. Like, we&#8217;re just a walking R&amp;D group over here in WordPress, and I love it. It&#8217;s fascinating. We&#8217;re just making the impossible possible every day, and I think that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sorry. I got really sidetracked. Do y&#8217;all have anything that you wanted to be sure to share about either the Interactivity API or anything that&#8217;s coming up? Something you wanna make that our listeners know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would just like to emphasize that we love feedback. Please share your feedback. If you test it, yeah, if you think it&#8217;s bad feedback, share it with us as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s especially the feedback we like. I don&#8217;t like this part. That&#8217;s great. We we want to know because the idea is that it serves all purposes for this kind of interactions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That nothing new, but I would like to emphasize that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You know what? There&#8217;s nothing new under the sun. It&#8217;s fine. You&#8217;re good. You should always tell people what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Ryan:</strong> If you&#8217;re interested in getting started with the Interactivity API and just don&#8217;t have any idea where to begin, there&#8217;s actually a pack there. There&#8217;s a Create Block template. So the Create Block package allows you to to quickly scaffold blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a template that&#8217;s part of the Gutenberg repository. It&#8217;s been published on it and NPM. And it will scaffold a very simple block out for you and it&#8217;ll give you, it&#8217;ll show you all the plumbing and how all the pieces work together. So, I think that&#8217;s a fantastic place to get started. It&#8217;s a very simple block. It just basically shows and hides a message, but it&#8217;s all done via the Interactivity API, but it&#8217;s a really, really great sort of, like, like, &#8216;Hello world&#8217; style. I&#8217;m gonna shamelessly self-promote myself at WordCamp Asia. I&#8217;ll be at WordCamp Asia this year doing a workshop where I will be doing some stuff with your Interactivity API. But, if you&#8217;re there and you wanna chat more about the Interactivity API, I am all ears, and I love talking about this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Cool. Ryan, Mario thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a wonderful conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So I hope that you all find that whole project as fascinating as I find it. The Interactivity API is, I know, something that we&#8217;ve kind of been talking about for a while. It showed up specifically in State of the Word, and it&#8217;s hard to understand how important, how vital that work is going to be until you really get your hands on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I recommend you get in there. You take a look at it. I think also Ryan has a few live streams that he does, and he&#8217;s planning on a couple for the Interactivity API coming up. And so just keep an eye out for all of that as we go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:37] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now that brings us to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, it&#8217;s a bunch of feedback and documentation. So, first things first. Did you know that the Documentation Team holds an online monthly Contributor Day on the fourth Tuesday of every month. It&#8217;s just an online docs day, and I love it. So, the next one that&#8217;s coming up is February 27th. We&#8217;re looking for folks to help. So show up, figure out how to get some docs done, and make the WordPress project easier to follow, one bit of documentation at a time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that I have is a request for feedback. So, we announced in December that we have a new centralized WordPress events landing page on WordPress.org, and we wanted to give more visibility to all kinds of WordPress events across the globe. But as always, we really could use your feedback about what is useful for you, what you had hoped to see, what you didn&#8217;t see. So, leave your comments with any relevant feedback about how you would improve those pages and the text on it. If you&#8217;re missing anything relevant, if there are ideas that you have for what could be there, all ideas are welcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, the third thing that I have on our list today is another documentation thing. So, over the last year, a group of contributors have been working to improve the block development onboarding experience within the Block Editor handbook. That contains over 400 published pages, and the effort in 2023 to kind of overhaul that and make it easier was just the beginning. So, it&#8217;s a daunting task. It&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s complex, but improving documentation is one of the easiest ways to contribute to the WordPress project, especially If there are just quick fixes like typos or formatting. Feedback on the existing content, such as the new block tutorial, is invaluable. And so, if you have not taken a look at those yet, wander over to the show notes, click a link or two, take a look, get some feedback to us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

This reflects project-wide efforts to increase utilization of these respectively. However, positive sentiment about WordPress is down modestly, and more so among contributors. The analysis of the annual survey highlights certain areas that could benefit from increased attention in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the highlights split into three parts: logistics, general trends, and contributor sentiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Logistics</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Completions were up 17% in 2023, though short of a goal to double them, despite increased promotion and partnership with some hosting partners.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Polyglots team translated the survey from English into 9 different languages, the most ever for the survey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Debuted a new platform, Alchemer, for improved accessibility, usability, data collection, administration, and analysis.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The completion rate increased again from last year’s high of 63% to 79% in 2023, proving that investing some time in the new platform and clarifying wording was well worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">General trends</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>NPS* was 30.1 overall, with contributors at 27.9 and non-contributors at 32. The NPS has trended downward since 2021, when it was 45. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>60% of respondents indicate usage of Gutenberg, 8% are unsure, and 12% use something other than Gutenberg and/or the Classic Editor. This is up from 2022 (54%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>45% of respondents indicate that the WordPress Site Editor meets their site-building needs, 26% are indifferent, and 29% disagree.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>61% of respondents indicate familiarity with block themes and plugins. While this question was not asked previously, in 2022, 53% said they had used blocks<br>“In the new site editor.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security, performance, and stability were the top three critical areas respondents considered when building their website, plugin, theme, or style variation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>63% agree that WordPress is as good or better than other CMSs, down from 68% in 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents indicated that the best things about WordPress are that it is open source, has ample plugin options, incorporates good customization, is easy to use, and offers flexibility. This is similar to 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limitless configurations, performance, scalability, accessibility, integration, hosting, and support all saw 100% or more increases compared to 2022 regarding favorite things about WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents cited “too many plugins,” “the site editing experience,” “security,” and “performance” as the top four worst things about WordPress. Most interestingly, though, 16% indicated that none of the 20 topics were terrible, and there was a 43% decrease in the number of people indicating that “site editing is difficult to learn.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search engines and YouTube continue to be the two most common resources for finding information about WordPress, while those writing about WordPress, in general, saw a sharp decline year over year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor sentiment</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>58% of self-identified contributors to WordPress said they agree with the project’s roadmap plans for “Phase 3” and “Phase 4” as a good plan to enhance the WordPress experience for developers, creators, and publishers alike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While about one-third of respondents indicated they contribute to the WordPress project, only about half knew how to get involved, knew about WordCamps and meetups, understood the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com, and knew the benefits of open source.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Of 22 topics, the distribution of the top three things that WordPress needs to focus on from the perspective of contributors was broad, with only a 13.5% raw percentage point (1350 basis points) difference between performance (18.6%) in first position and collaborative editing (5.1%) in 22nd position. This shows a need for more consensus among contributors regarding where to focus resources and/or illustrates that the project has many essential elements with passionate supporters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fewer contributors had a positive experience in 2023 (55%) versus 2022 (64%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Similarly, the feeling of being welcome in the WordPress community among contributors decreased to 57% versus 64% in 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furthermore, contributors feel appropriately recognized less in 2023 (46%) than in 2022 (51%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bringing it all together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 annual WordPress survey participation and results highlight the possibility of survey burnout within the WordPress community and some declining overall satisfaction among contributors. There is an opportunity to increase awareness regarding critical initiatives such as WordCamps and other resources for WordPress users and contributors alike and to increase messaging on improvements made within the project to the CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s planned for 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next iteration of the survey, the plan is to improve the survey’s questions further to ensure they continue to provide valuable insight into the project’s trends. This means some questions will be replaced while others might be refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, plans are being explored to distribute and promote the survey at each of the three annual flagship WordCamps (Europe, U.S., and Asia). This would be in contrast to a single yearly survey. More exploration on this topic will take place in the months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2024/02/2023-WordPress-Annual-Survey-Results-Deck.pdf\">View the 2023 Slide Deck</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reporting.alchemer.com/r/738278_655bbaa5598b14.93675163\">View a web-based version of the results.</a> <em>Note that this link may expire in the future.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>*<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/net-promoter-score-calculation\">What is NPS?</a> Simply put, NPS is a KPI organizations can use to measure how likely it’s [users, clients, members] are to recommend a product or service. It can serve as a general indicator of brand strength and affinity. Most organizations use NPS, which can be used to benchmark an organization in an industry against a set of peers. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dansoschin/\">@dansoschin</a> for the analysis and editorial support.

You’ll find more ways to manage your fonts and styles, notable upgrades to synced patterns, a collection of Site Editor and performance updates to help you get things done, and new ways to leverage design tools in Classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will include breakthrough foundational APIs that will start to transform how you use blocks to build memorable experiences. This release invites you to dig into these early-stage frameworks, discover how you’d like to see them evolve, and have an impact on their future improvements and capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excited yet? Keep reading for some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet the Font Library</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially slated for release in WordPress 6.4, the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59166\">Font Library</a> is one of those great things worth the wait. It gives you new capabilities for efficiently managing a vital piece of your site’s design—typography—without coding or extra steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Font Library, you can handle fonts across your site regardless of your active theme—much like how you manage assets in the Media Library. You can install local fonts or Google Fonts, and it’s easily extensible, with the ability to add your own custom typography collections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Synced patterns get an upgrade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reusable-blocks/\">Synced patterns</a> bring efficiency to the design process, letting you make global changes to particular layouts with minimal effort. However, there’s often a need to make contextual changes when it comes to content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 introduces new enhancements to synced patterns that let you override the content in each specific instance. You can choose what content can be updated within a synced pattern—while maintaining the design and layout you’ve already created. Use it for templated pieces like recipes, testimonials, or case studies that use recurring elements to frame unique content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This major release will introduce overrides for the Paragraph, Image, Heading, and Button blocks, with support for more blocks to come as work on synced patterns continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connecting blocks and custom fields or other dynamic content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will finally make it possible to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53300#issuecomment-1938463648\">connect core block attributes to custom fields</a>. This capability lets you use the value of a custom field without creating custom blocks. For example, a digital publication could use custom fields with Paragraph and Image blocks. It could pull information from its individual staff writer profiles to dynamically display on its team page, like headshots and names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">Block Bindings API</a> powers this functionality and is designed to be extensible enough for developers to connect blocks to any dynamic content—not just custom fields. If your data is stored elsewhere, you can easily point blocks to that new source with only a few lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first step in a larger project to simplify how custom fields and other dynamic content are managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Interactivity API gets baked into Core</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as just a taste in WordPress 6.4 with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/51132\">lightbox feature for images</a> is officially making its way into Core. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks\">Interactivity API</a> is a new framework that offers developers a standardized method to bring interactive front-end experiences, or interactions, to blocks. It aims to simplify the process, with less dependencies on external tooling, while maintaining optimal performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interactions create engaging user experiences, whether showing new comments or fetching search results without reloading a page, allowing visitors to interact with content in real time, or incorporating effects like countdowns and transitional animations that surprise and delight. Check out <a href=\"https://wpmovies.dev/\">this demo site to get a taste of what this framework can do</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.5 is just the beginning of bringing this developer experience into Core. Find out how you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56803\">follow along with the work or lend a hand</a> and test more features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get more from your revisions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Revisions are the markers of progress. For creative projects, they&#8217;re also a welcome fallback when you&#8217;re working through a new design or concept. This release brings more detail to your style revision history in the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/01/22/core-editor-improvement-robust-revisions-in-the-site-editor/\">Style revisions in 6.5</a> present a more detailed picture of your work, with design updates like time stamps, quick summaries that outline changes, and the ability to see a full list of revisions made—not just the previous 100. View revisions from the Style Book to see changes that aren&#8217;t reflected in the template you&#8217;re working on. Style revisions are also newly available for templates and template parts, giving you a broader view of your site’s changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect to see more <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/\">work happening to expand and improve revisions across the WordPress experience</a>. It’s a foundational part of the collaborative editing and workflows focus of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Gutenberg project&#8217;s Phase 3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Classic themes can opt into appearance tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the design experience in Block themes evolves and improves, many of these upgrades are also available for Classic themes. Theme authors can choose to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60118\">add support for appearance tools to any Classic theme</a>—even without the use of theme.json. Opting in gives designers and site creators using Classic themes access to a varied set of design options, from <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-wp-theme-json.php#L576\">spacing and border controls to typography and color options</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching themes can feel like a big undertaking, and for folks who aren’t ready to jump into the flexibility of Block themes, these pathways to adoption can help ease that tension. Once a Classic theme gets initial support for appearance tools, more design options will be automatically added as they become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More design tools are on the way</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each WordPress release brings more thought and attention to the way you can create with the Site Editor. The latest improvements to the design experience help bring your creative vision to life:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/57005\">Background images for Group blocks get size and repeat support</a>, letting you play with subtle or splashy ways to add visual interest to your layouts.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56897\">Aspect ratio support for the Cover block</a> gives you more control over your Cover block images’ shape and size.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57103\">Shadow support added to more blocks</a> to help create layouts with visual depth or add a little personality to your design.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Site Editor updates to streamline your workflow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring ease and simplicity to your site-building process with the latest advancements to the Site Editor’s capabilities, from important interface improvements to upgraded tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going beyond Group blocks, you can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54426\">rename every block in the List View</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55188\">rename</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55292\">duplicate</a> individual patterns to help keep them organized. Other notable UI improvements add access to your block settings with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50273\">quick right-click from List View</a>, adjust preferences with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56510\">consolidated settings in the Editor preferences panel</a>, and the ability to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56295\">block toolbar on hover when you’re in Distraction Free mode</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also notice a cleaner and more unified link-building experience that <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50891\">improves link controls</a>, making it easier to create and manage links in various blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release has a bounty of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33683\">drag-and-drop enhancements</a> to make your editing experience feel more intuitive. You’ll notice helpful visual adjustments, like <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56625\">displaced items in List View</a> when you drag them around to reorganize. You’ll also find that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56070\">drag and drop anywhere you’d like</a> in the Editor, from the very beginning to the end of your workspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Data Views in the Site Editor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every piece of your site comes with a library of information and data. Organizing it, finding what you need, and making informed changes should be as effortless as your site editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 includes <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/55083\">data views</a> for pages, templates, patterns, and template parts. You can view data in a table or grid view, with a new UI for toggling fields and making bulk changes. It’s a refreshing and feature-rich experience that leads the way for the upcoming <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/12/admin-design/\">Admin Redesign project</a> on the WordPress roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plugin dependencies improve the plugin experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 improves <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/57545\">how users manage plugins that require other plugins</a>. Plugin authors can supply a new <code>Requires Plugins</code> header with a comma-separated list of required plugin slugs from the WordPress.org Plugins repository, which will present users with links to install and activate those plugins first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Required plugins must remain active and installed for as long as plugins that require them are active and installed. If any required plugins become inactive or uninstalled, the plugins that require them will be automatically deactivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Big performance gains across the editing experience and more</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 contains more than 110 performance-related updates, including an impressive <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57935\">increase in speed and efficiency</a> across both the Post Editor and Site Editor. Loading is over two times faster than in 6.4, with input processing speed increasing to nearly four times faster than the previous release. You’ll also find yourself navigating through the Site Editor six times faster than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loading time for translated sites gets a boost due to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">merging Performant Translations into Core</a>. This greatly improves the load time of translated sites across the board by loading multiple locales simultaneously, making switching between them a faster and more enjoyable experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility highlights</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring that WordPress remains highly accessible is crucial for its success and fulfilling the mission of democratizing publishing. With this in mind, 6.5 will ship more than 65 updates to improve accessibility throughout the platform. These updates include fixes to contrast settings, cursor focus, submenus, positioning of elements, and more.

feature Sunita Rai, a content marketer originally from a remote village in the hills of Nepal. Sunita&#8217;s journey to academic and professional success, with help from the WordPress community, will inspire many.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita Rai at WordCamp Asia\" class=\"wp-image-16707\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1536%2C960&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A strong desire to acquire knowledge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools first opened in Sunita’s village in the late 1970s, but most locals, including her parents, had neither the funds nor opportunities to complete their education. Over the years, they realized that an education could open doors for their children. Sunita&#8217;s parents vowed to ensure she received a full education, no matter the costs or hardships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her father worked as a seasonal laborer in India and ensured Sunita and her siblings could go to school with the proper supplies. Her mother cared for everything at home, both the family and the farm. Money was scarce, but determination was abundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish high school, Sunita moved in with her aunt in a nearby city. After graduation, she worked as a teacher. One of the biggest challenges was speaking and writing in English, a requirement for her first job teaching at a private English-language school. Her own education had used Nepali as the language of instruction. Fortunately, she enjoyed writing in English and became more fluent with practice. She discovered that she would always want a career where she could continue learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of a demanding teaching schedule, Sunita continued her studies at a college affiliated with Tribhuvan University. She knew that doing both would be difficult, but she wanted to be able to support her family while pursuing ambitious life and career goals. Earning a bachelor’s degree was a hugely motivating achievement that inspired her to begin a master’s degree in sociology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching for more than five years had been a full-time commitment, with hours of extra work at home. Preparing lessons, grading assignments, and handling exams made it difficult for her to find the time needed for her own studies. Sunita decided she needed more time for her coursework, so she left her teaching job and sought work that would allow her to focus on her studies while still earning money.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita at basecamp Trekking Nepal in November 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16709\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From teaching to writing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After an extensive search, Sunita landed a content writing job at a successful WordPress development firm in Nepal. Her salary as a content writer wasn’t high, but it grew steadily over time. She would later gain some supplementary freelance work after presenting at a WordCamp. She was able to help support her family as she grew in her career, and now she could do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I’m fortunate to have had the education that gave me the capacity to aspire, get into a WordPress job, meet people from around the world, and tell my story!</p>\n<cite>Sunita</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in her career, especially in her early days with WordPress, Sunita benefited from the support of excellent mentors who played pivotal roles in her career development, nurturing her skills in content writing, SEO, and general confidence. Now, she has mentored other content writers and advocates for mentoring programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita speaking at WordCamp Asia 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16706\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita has engaged in WordCamps, sharing her wealth of knowledge and experiences. Her first WordCamp was <a href=\"https://nepal.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Nepal 2015</a>, a pivotal moment where she connected with WordPress enthusiasts from various Nepalese and international companies. She experienced a welcoming environment that inspired her to become involved in the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2016\">WordCamp Kathmandu in 2016</a>, Sunita delivered a talk on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/12/01/sunita-rai-seo-copywriting-for-wordpress/\">SEO Copywriting for WordPress</a>, marking a significant milestone in her journey. She later joined a panel discussion titled &#8220;Girls in WordPress – Story, Experience, Opportunity, and Career&#8221; at <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/2018/\">WordCamp Biratnagar 2018</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Sunita helped organize speakers at WordCamp Kathmandu <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2022/\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2023/\">2023</a>, and also spoke outside her home country at <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023\">WordCamp Asia 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://sylhet.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Sylhet, Bangladesh 2023</a>. These events and her <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=sunita%20rai\">talks</a>, helped her grow stronger connections within the global WordPress community and encourage more women speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=900%2C675&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with members from the WordPress Bangladesh community\" class=\"wp-image-16711\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Translating WordPress and empowering others</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and writing in your own language is powerful. For Sunita, translation is crucial in bridging gaps and granting access to those with limited platforms to express and share their passions. When she discovered that she could translate WordPress into Nepali, she joined the many other volunteers on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Translating WordPress to Nepali means empowering my people to access the freedom that WordPress provides.&#8221;&nbsp;</h2>\n<cite>Sunita Rai</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with 3 Female Oganizers WordCamp Kathmandu 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16710\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita emphasizes that coding skills are not a prerequisite for contribution: &#8220;The potential impact you can have on the WordPress community is enormous, across areas from local meetups and WordCamps to testing and translating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights her own experience as a potential path for others. &#8220;WordPress has had a profound impact on my life&#8230; the freedom to work on my own time, to be financially independent, and to overcome my inferiority complex.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her advice to anyone getting started with WordPress: “Get involved in the WordPress community and contribute as early as possible.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;<br><br>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, it is February. For many of us, that means we&#8217;ve already fallen off track on our New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but not you, intrepid WordPresser, especially you, newly found WordPresser who is still on the fence about needing a website, and I get it. It seems like a lot of work, and even if you shoot for the moon, it&#8217;s not clear which star you&#8217;ll land on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It feels easier to open a Facebook page or launch a new Instagram account, get a channel going on YouTube, but here&#8217;s a secret they won&#8217;t tell you. It&#8217;s just as much work. And even if you crack the code on today&#8217;s algorithm, you don&#8217;t own anything you build there, not the content, not the audience. So if you&#8217;re gonna make the effort to build anyway, why not build it in your space? It can be scary to take that kind of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re not convinced yet, let me give you a few other reasons why you should choose a website over some social media thing. I&#8217;ve got a list here, and they build on one another, really. But the first thing is a website covers the five W&#8217;s: who, what, when, where, and why. It&#8217;s basic information, I know, but it&#8217;s what people need to know when they&#8217;re looking at your product or company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phone book, whether you had the yellow pages or the white pages, those are long gone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the need for that information is gone. When people are researching the right service or product to solve their problems, they&#8217;re getting online to do it. So you should be there, and your information should be easy to find.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us right into item number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people know these things about you when, they know who you are, what you&#8217;re doing, when to get to you, where you are, why you&#8217;re doing it. Having that information increases trust and makes you look more professional, and I&#8217;ve seen that be counterintuitive for folks. I mean, it&#8217;s a digital asset, after all. But overwhelmingly, we see consumers who are well-researched by the time they get to us. They&#8217;ve looked at all of your competitors already and checked to see if you are a human, if you share some of their values, and how you manage waste or, complaints, or praise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can never know who is looking for you. So, making it all as clear and easy to see as possible makes you more trustworthy. And the more trustworthy and professional you look, then number three, the more chances you have to bring in good leads and contacts, which can turn into sales or, at the very least, a sales opportunity. And it&#8217;s important to have good leads and contacts. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you have your information out there on a website, then people can sort of prequalify themselves. If they already have a sense for whether they are a good fit for your product or service, then fingers crossed. You can spend most of your time with people who are making serious inquiries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And coming in at four, you can do this any way you want with words or art, NFTs of your latest work, or video tutorials. It lets you tell your story in ways that other mediums necessarily have to limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, importantly, you can still do those things elsewhere. Right? But having essentially a digital home online that is yours, keep your stuff online in a place you own and operate, then draw people to you through those other channels. Make it all work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have a fifth thing, mostly because I like lists of either three or five, and the list I had was four, but also because it&#8217;s true. Number five is still true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting domains is fun. You&#8217;ve got something to share with the world, and your domain name is title and, story, and first impression. And isn&#8217;t it great instead of having to say you can find me at LinkedIn, slash in slash, etc.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can say something quick and memorable. Josepha.blog or whatever it is you registered. Getting domains is fun. It&#8217;s the fifth thing, and I tried to act like it was no big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also, it&#8217;s like one of the first things you have to do, and it&#8217;s kind of a big deal. You can have your own domain, and it can say a lot for you. So there you have it, some basic and not-so-basic reasons why you should have a website. If you are convinced or at least intrigued, I&#8217;ve got a few tutorials that can help you get started that I&#8217;ll link in the show notes.&nbsp;<br><br>[00:05:03] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have four big things for you today: four-ish. So, first things first, I have some early opportunities for y&#8217;all to test our next major release. Our next major release is WordPress 6.5. The target release date is March 26th. But coming up here on February 13th, we have Beta 1 scheduled. That&#8217;s an early opportunity for you to provide feedback. A lot of the features that we have coming in this release are big, and they&#8217;re moving quite quickly. And so, if you are already a routine WordPress user, pop on over into the core channel or onto make.WordPress.org/core and get your hands on that beta release. We could use a lot of feedback from you on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I have is that the second cohort of the Contributor Mentorship Program has opened up, and we&#8217;re calling for participants whether you want to be mentored or mentor somebody. We are accepting applications for both. This is a fantastic opportunity for experienced contributors to help other people learn how to do this. And also, if you are learning to contribute to open source and to WordPress for the first time, I know it can be scary. It took me many, many tries to really get started. And so this is a great opportunity for anyone who is trying to contribute in a new way, in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing that I have is there&#8217;s a post up about Data Liberation in 2024. This is one of our big focuses for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A web where being locked into a system should be a thing of the past, and migrating your site to WordPress or around the WordPress ecosystem should be doable with essentially 1-click, and, so, there&#8217;s a lot of work that we&#8217;re doing there. You can find it on WordPress.org/data-liberation. There will be a link to that in our show notes, but also, there is a lot of work that has to be done, not only to get those resources together but also some companion tools to the resources. So head on over there, take a look at what&#8217;s out there. And if you have some stuff to contribute, share that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And my fourth thing, my final thing, is that WordCamp Asia is about a month away. So you still have time to plan your attendance. If that&#8217;s something that you want to do, head on over to asia.wordcamp.org to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser or specifically for this one; if you liked what you heard, share it with a fellow collaborator whether they know WordPress or not. But if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at wpbriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> Today, we&#8217;ve got a throwback episode about blogging. If you&#8217;re like me, you sometimes miss the early days of blogs, where the words were a little more pensive, and the images were a little less professional. If you&#8217;re on a slow hobby journey like so many of us are right now, give this one a listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:58] (music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning. You may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their own project or business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool. We have long since outgrown that, but even 20 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because, even after those 20 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same, and that is to democratize publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help people have a place online where they can tell their stories, or share their projects, or set up their businesses. If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So, I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, Oh, Jospeha, how old fashioned. I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website. And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand, before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first-ever website. So let&#8217;s dive in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So, have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, but also some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first, cause like, if you want the domain name WordPress.org, like, we own that, you can&#8217;t have that. But if you know that you want a domain like &#8216;WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com&#8217; like, that one might be more available. And if you know kind of the words you want in your domain, then you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mention all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it&#8217;s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start before you even know what WordPress is most of the time. So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is, what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date. There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service, where they will keep your WordPress software up to date and provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So it ranges all the way from full service like that, all the way down to essentially zero service, just kind of hands off. They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site, but they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you; they leave updating up to you, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself and the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software, and what you want, and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either services with the existing host that you chose or moving to a different host; however, that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually, most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click, and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, on the other side of that spectrum, that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server, or you know how to work in this thing called cPanel, etc. So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to WordPress.org/download and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment. Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little, I&#8217;ve got you covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the LearnWP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host, as well as various other early steps of this process. If you felt like I blazed through all of that, which, honestly, I kind of did. You can work through those lessons in that course at your own pace, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this &#8216;Hello World&#8217; post. There&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare, like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMSs in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh. We&#8217;ve got now a website. We know kind of how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can be moderated, and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some choose-your-own-adventure guiding questions here. Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words? Mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want, three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to WordPress.org/themes and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to WordPress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically, so that you can see how things look right away. And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site, so if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely. And just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every WordPress instance ships with a theme, and it is fully functional when you get your site up and running, so you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready. And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites, is to add plugins to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality to it. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions? If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there. If that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find. And as a general side note here as well, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine. I&#8217;ll tell you this, I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms, and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So, yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the one hand, you definitely can. And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem and, obviously, hear some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Josepha</strong>: Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for for years, but also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009, and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy. We are the easiest of the hard options for CMSs like content management systems are just complicated. But we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game like you should have had a website for years, I mean, sure, that could be true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second best time to plant that tree is today. WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:18] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:25] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And now, our small list of big things. Today we&#8217;ve got some look-back items and some look-forward items. So let&#8217;s hop right in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing is we have a year in review with the themes team. So much amazing work has been done by the themes team over the past year, both for reviewing themes and creating them. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to those in the show notes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a post out that just has some general celebrations from teams around the community. I&#8217;ll leave a link to that. It probably has been linked in quite a few places, but you know, we don&#8217;t always embrace those moments of celebration. We don&#8217;t always embrace our wins. And so it&#8217;s always good to share those early and often. There are probably more than just those two. So if you posted one or you saw a really interesting one that you think that we should know about, don&#8217;t forget to share it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Next, we have a leap into 2024 with Site Editor tools. So, on the new Developer Blog, if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, there is a lot of excellent content there for whether you are like an advanced developer in WordPress or you&#8217;re kind of intermediate and ready to move into your advanced developer era.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Editor will give you a powerful way to visually create every part of your site and tell your story. And this post will help you to kind of see how to handle everything from big style changes to simple copy updates, all in a single place. We want to make sure that you get the most out of your WordPress this year. And that post will give you a few standout tools and features that you&#8217;ll want to try.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll also want to keep an eye out for updates as we move into 2024 around team reps. So each team in the WordPress project goes through a process to review and elect team reps, and elections are happening now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Along with things that are happening now that you should keep an eye on, the annual goals, our big picture post has gone out as well. It went out at the end of the week last week. There&#8217;ll be a link to all of these in the show notes. And yeah, keep an eye out for, hopefully, a fantastic 2024 in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

That’s why I announced a new initiative called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Data Liberation</a> for 2024. Migrating your site to WordPress, or exporting all your content from WordPress, should be possible in one click. I want WordPress’ export format to become the lingua franca of CMSes, whether coming to WordPress or moving within WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I often hear about folks across the WordPress community duplicating efforts when creating scripts and workflows to move users to WordPress. Imagine if we shared those resources instead and built community-owned plugins that anyone could use! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it should be more than plugins; workflows, tutorials, and helper scripts should be shared, too. I want this resource to have space to include moving from social networks, moving from a page builder to core blocks, switching from classic to blocks, and improving WordPress current canonical plugins for importing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You can help!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the heart of any open source project is the community that shows up to build it. My hope is that this marks the start of a new contribution pathway, separate from core teams, that allows folks to contribute what they’ve learned and what they’ve created to help others move to WordPress. I expect this emphasis on migration will also influence future development, both in core and with recommended community or canonical plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that I think will be key to making this project a success:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A dedicated landing page on WordPress.org following a WordPress.org/and/[platform-name] format.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A forum used for non-review user feedback and general discussion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A dedicated Slack channel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Moderation within hours rather than days.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Listed on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress\">WordPress GitHub</a> with syncing for individual commits to SVN for history in both places.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By complementing the community’s existing efforts—the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future program</a>, the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress initiative</a>, a focus on internationalization, etc.—my hope is that this will help even more people see themselves in the WordPress project, providing fresh momentum for <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/\">WordCamps and meetups</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s never been more crucial to champion openness on the web. Bringing focused attention to improved portability will untether users and increase their freedom like never before.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"16736\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WP Briefing: Episode 70: A Look Ahead at WordPress in 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/01/episode-70-a-look-ahead-at-wordpress-in-2024/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 Jan 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=16677\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:264:\"Curious about WordPress\'s big-picture items for 2024?

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hello, my dears, and welcome to 2024. I hope you&#8217;ve had a lovely break. At the top of the year, I like to look around and gather the projects that the community is interested in. We can&#8217;t always commit to everything, and sometimes even the things we plan to do can&#8217;t make it across the finish line. In the next few weeks, I&#8217;ll be publishing kind of the big picture goals for the year, but I wanted to share a little bit about what I&#8217;ve collected so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Firstly, we&#8217;ve got Phase 3. This has been called a few things over the years: collaborative editing, multiplayer, co-editing. But whatever it&#8217;s been called, the biggest changes to writing and design workflows are likely to happen in this phase. A redesigned workflow can be a bit of a shock. But fortunately, we already have a prototype out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll include a link to some resources in the show notes, or of course, you can always stop by make.WordPress.org/core for some insights. But I would encourage you to, at the very least, get your hands on that prototype to see what it looks like is coming in Phase 3 so that you can be aware and provide your feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing on our list is Data Liberation. This is a new-to-us project that was introduced at State of the Word. Fortunately, though, it&#8217;s not a new concept overall. Data Liberation is actually one of the earliest ideas that sold me on WordPress. The idea that you could set up a site for a client, or yourself, and that hard work wasn&#8217;t lost if something went wrong, was really important to me. It&#8217;s been a long time since we put any effort into our importers and exporters, and I think this will be a good focus for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that I&#8217;ve picked up, kind of a list of three things, but there are three mid-sized areas that I want us to pay attention to this year: plugins, old tickets, and new meetups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins, because they really have turned a corner on where they ended 2023. A lot of work has been done to make sure that they&#8217;ve streamlined some efforts, gotten some better onboarding for folks as they&#8217;re going in, and we could really use a hand to keep that momentum going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Old tickets, because it&#8217;s something that we hope for year after year when we&#8217;re talking to people about what they want in new releases. So often, part of what they say is some way to work through all of these old things that have been around forever, some with patches. And why not, after all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then new meetups, because I really still think that meetups are the best intro to WordPress. No matter whether you&#8217;re wanting to become a developer eventually or, like, the community-building aspect is the thing that hooks you forever. Meetups are the place to encourage those and discover those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing on my list is also two things. It&#8217;s two things, but kind of a guess at the moment. There are two summit items that I want us to try to consider this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one is contributor recognition. Acknowledgment and recognition, I think, are two different things, and there was an entire series of sessions at the summit where we talked about it. And so I think that it&#8217;s worth us digging in on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing from the summit that I would really like us to all kind of dig in on is accessibility, how we do it, how we confirm it, what we think we should do versus what we actually do, and see what we can move on the needle there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing is sort of a personal wish. I think it&#8217;s about time that we take a look at the way that we kind of manage ourselves as a project, the way that we do our meetings and report on our successes, things like that. And I realize that this is a big thing, and it might be a little bit scary. But, I mean, we&#8217;ve been doing this for a really long time, and it&#8217;s probably as good a time as any, frankly, to look at what we&#8217;re doing by habit or tradition and see if it still suits us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s my back of the napkin set of notes so far. Keep an eye out in the next couple of weeks for the annual Big Picture post so you can get some context, notes, and discussion opportunities. And, of course, anything that has shown up that&#8217;s a bit bigger, a bit more final will be in there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, our small list of big things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:52] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Firstly, State of the Word had nearly 200 questions submitted, and Matt has been answering the overflow on make.WordPress.org/project. So, I&#8217;ll include a link, but head on over there to that post if you would like to catch up on those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second item, and last item, is that you&#8217;ve got a few more days left to give us feedback on WordPress meetups in 2023, and give us an idea of what we can do to improve those. I believe those close on January 14th. I really love my local meetup, and I hope that we can get some of that same sort of feeling going in all of yours, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

There’s a lot to cover, and the team is excited to see it released. We’ve got bug fixes, performance improvements, and some breaking changes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We’ve trimmed legacy code, removed some previously-deprecated APIs, removed some internal-only parameters to public functions that were never documented, and dropped support for some “magic” behaviors that were overly complicated.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The post includes an overview of the changes, starting with the highlight: dropping support for IE10 and older. The team planned to part with IE11 after Microsoft ended support in 2022 but <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/5077#issuecomment-1730205609\">eventually decided</a> to push this change to v5 to avoid any more blockers to the v4 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming release uses ES modules and switches from RequireJS to Rollup for packaging. It also removes 13 deprecated functions that “were either always meant to be internal or ones that now have native equivalents in all supported browsers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>78 Million Websites Use jQuery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adherence to modern browser behavior and specs is a common thread in the announcement post. Indeed, browsers have come a long way since January 2006, when jQuery was launched, Internet Explorer had a 90% market share, and front-end development was a constant struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, with <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=es6\">99.84% browser support</a> for ES6, a slew of well-supported <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API\">Web APIs</a>, and robust upgrades to CSS—when we can run a full-blown <a href=\"https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/\">WordPress instance in the browser</a> using WebAssembly—do we still need a 1.25 MB DOM manipulation library?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1al08pe/comment/kpi131o\">the words of an opinionated Redditor</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Look, jQuery was incredible and it changed JS in incredible ways. It made the JS developer experience incredible because it was so inventive. And the JS community and TC39 implemented so many things that jQ did incredible. It was one of the goals of jQ &#8211; set standards and improve the JS language. And it worked. And it&#8217;s no longer needed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Judging by online statistics, the answer is an unequivocal “YES!”. jQuery might be the uncool kid in the front-end neighborhood, but its market share dwarfs the hipper frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on NPM, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery\">jQuery 3.7.1</a>, released in August 2023, boasts over 9 million weekly downloads and has more than 20k dependent packages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuiltWith <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/jQuery\">indicates</a> that over 78 million websites use jQuery, while W3Techs <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery\">reports</a> that “jQuery is used by 94.4% of all the websites whose JavaScript library we know. This is 77.1% of all websites.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Legacy Dependency</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the chief reasons for jQuery’s relentless popularity is being instrumental to the ecosystem. Namely, it’s bundled in WordPress Core and is part of numerous themes and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress’ adoption of React-based Gutenberg has lowered its dependency on jQuery. During a Developer Hours session hosted a week after Willison’s announcement, titled <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2024/02/13/developer-hours-javascript-for-modern-wordpress-development/\">JavaScript for modern WordPress development</a>, Automattic’s developer advocates Ryan Welcher and Nick Diego spent more than an hour diving into JS tools and techniques to build blocks and editor extensions; they didn’t once mention jQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/10/04/the-performance-impact-of-using-jquery-in-wordpress-themes/\">post published</a> in October 2021 on the Make Themes blog, core contributor Felix Arntz urged theme developers to move away from jQuery to improve performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60478\">TRAC ticket opened</a> on the day of Willison’s announcement reported the news and enquired, “Is this something that wp core will be looking to implement?”. Andrew Ozz, Lead Developer at Automattic, replied, “Of course :)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a 43% share of the CMS market, WordPress could be the serum of jQuery’s longevity.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"122\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jQuery-logo-500x122.png\" alt=\"jQuery\'s logo and tagline: write less, do more\" class=\"wp-image-154072\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The last time WP Tavern <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tag/jquery\">covered jQuery</a> was in 2020, when jQuery Migrate 1.4.1 was removed from WordPress 5.5, causing themes and plugins to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Core team’s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-jquery-migrate-helper/\">Enable jQuery Migrate Helper</a> plugin—<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/enable-jquery-migrate-helper-plugin-passes-10k-active-installs\">launched</a> to tackle these problems—is still maintained and has 100k active installs. It also has some glaring reviews about how helpful it is. Why would people building WordPress websites in 2024 need to use a plugin designed “as a temporary solution, enabling the migration script for your site to give your plugin and theme authors some more time to update, and test, their code.”?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Trailblazer that Moves the Web Forward</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer lies in an alarming comment found on W3Techs. A third of the websites that use jQuery run a version older than 3.x (3.0.0 was released in June 2016).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These results correlate with <a href=\"https://openjsf.org/blog/jquery-idc-research\">a smaller-scoped study</a> conducted by the OpenJS Foundation and IDC in November 2023. Out of 509 survey respondents, 89% confirmed they use jQuery, with 56% deploying older versions, some no longer maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open-source and standardization expert Tobie Langel, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/papers.html#jquery\">speaking at</a> the W3C’s Secure the Web Forward workshop, believes “jQuery’s massive reach and longevity” puts it in a unique position: if securing jQuery means securing the web, then “Once again&#8211;and against all odds&#8211;jQuery can be a trailblazer and help move the web forward.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s already an ongoing effort: <a href=\"https://openssf.org/blog/2022/10/24/openssf-project-alpha-omega-invests-in-the-openjs-foundation-and-jquery-to-help-secure-the-consumer-web/\">In October 2022</a>, the <a href=\"https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/\">Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Project Alpha-Omega</a> awarded jQuery a $350k grant to “reduce potential security incidents for jQuery by helping modernize its consumers and its code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backed by industry giants like the Linux Foundation, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, and part of the OpenJS Foundation supported by GoDaddy, IBM, Joyent, and the Sovereign Tech Fund, jQuery seems like it will get to live to see more than just another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How about you?

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have with me today a couple of guests, Ryan Welcher and Mario Santos, who have joined me to talk about the Interactivity API. This is an API that we&#8217;ve been working on for quite a while, and it&#8217;s a fascinating thing. It&#8217;s really specifically user-facing in its functionality but makes a lot of work streamlined for everyday developers, whether you are building something for yourself, for your family, or for a client. This whole project probably is gonna really speak to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hi, guys, and welcome to the show. First-time guests, both of you. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:15] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yes. First time for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:17] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thanks for inviting us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Well, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, like your name, what you do with WordPress, how you contribute to the project, something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I can go first. My name is Ryan Welcher. I&#8217;m a developer advocate and sponsored by Automattic. Then, I contribute full-time to the WordPress project by creating documentation, doing live streams, creating videos, and just generally trying to be helpful in in the space to help engineers and extenders work with the various APIs in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love the just generally trying to be helpful part. Mario, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:52] <strong>Mario:</strong> He really is. He really does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:55] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m Mario Santos. I&#8217;m also a sponsored contributor, and I&#8217;m more focused on the project management and developer. I consider myself a mix of both. Right now I&#8217;m working on projects that are focused on improving the developer experience especially. That can go from the Block API to the Interactivity API; that is the topic today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Very nice. Very nice. Just lots of helping that everyone&#8217;s trying to do. I think that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;re talking about the Interactivity API today. And, Mario, I believe it was almost a year ago that you first put this proposal out into the WordPress project. Do you wanna tell us a little bit about just, like, where the idea of this came from? Like, I know it wasn&#8217;t originally called the Interactivity API, but, like, what was you said you do some a bit of product, a bit of development. Like, what was it about this idea that was so important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:48] <strong>Mario:</strong> Yeah. Sure. So, basically, well, the proposal came, like, one year ago, but it has been in the works, like, for many years, I would say. Just to give a bit more context, previously, before being a sponsored contributor, I was working at a startup called Frontity Framework, and we were building a React framework to enable rich user experiences on top of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So basically, it was a framework for headless WordPress. And at some point, we became sponsored contributors, the idea was to bring those user experiences to those rich and cool websites that lead to WordPress. So, you don&#8217;t need an external framework to create them, and you can do that directly in WordPress. So that&#8217;s where the idea of the Interactivity API comes from. From there, we started exploring different possibilities and tailoring it more to WordPress to ensure it works with its APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think after many many months working on that, the Interactivity API is the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I just wanted to note that you started that answer with, like, the proposal was about a year ago, but the work had been happening for a long time. I think that&#8217;s generally true, and it&#8217;s not something that we always really acknowledge. This happens with patents also. This is going to be a strange tangent, but this is how we do in in my brain. This is how my brain works. So frequently, you&#8217;ll see a brand new product, but the patent for it was, like, 30 years beforehand, like, way before you ever see anything. And I think that&#8217;s kinda how this works also with software development. Like, the idea, has been going for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The problem was identified a long time ago. And by the time you see something that helps to solve the problem or bring a new set of features to you, like, you didn&#8217;t know, but it had been being worked on for, like, five years or something. And I think that&#8217;s such a fascinating thing. That&#8217;s always apparent to me, but I think it&#8217;s not really apparent for a lot of people in the, in I don&#8217;t know, who use software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna say in the space, quote, unquote, but that&#8217;s not even it. Like, it&#8217;s the people who are using software. We don&#8217;t know how long anything&#8217;s been under development. We just know that at some point, a magical thing appeared, and we get to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So speaking of the problems that we have identified that we&#8217;re trying to solve with this. Like, was there an inherent problem that you all were trying to solve as you were coming up with this idea around the Interactivity API itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:16] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say that trying to summarize it, it covers many things, but the main problem was that creating those kinds of interactions in the client was kind of difficult. You had to manage many things many tools, and each developer could come up with different solutions, and maybe they don&#8217;t combine well together. So, the idea is to provide an extended way so developers don&#8217;t have to take care of many things. They just have to take care of the interactions they wanna create. And ensuring that it works well with the WordPress way, it works well with the block system, and any block created with this Interactivity API can communicate with each other. You can combine those blocks, and you are not gonna encounter any problem. So, I would say that the main issue we were trying to solve is that there wasn&#8217;t a standard solution. There were different approaches taken by different developers, and that could create some issues. So, until now, Gutenberg has been mainly focused on the editor side and how blocks are created. And this is a first attempt to to cover the part of the front end, the interactions that users may want to create in the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] <strong>Ryan:</strong> It solves a ton of problems. But, I mean, coming from someone like, I have a fair amount of agency experience. I&#8217;ve been, you know, you&#8217;re working on large projects. And every time someone solves a problem, they solve it slightly differently. And that&#8217;s problematic because you switch teams or, you know, someone else picks up the code base, and all of a sudden, now they have to learn your custom system that&#8217;s slightly different from the one that I built last week and the one that, you know, someone else built two weeks earlier. And this takes the guesswork out. It takes the sort of the plumbing out of the equation. One of the reasons I really loves working with WordPress when I started working with WordPress was that when I was building for clients, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building the CMS. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building a menu system or figuring out how to handle media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:10] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I just had to do the things that that client was paying me to do. Like, I just had to make their site look the way that they wanted it to. And with the Interactivity API, I think there&#8217;s a bit of that where I don&#8217;t have to worry about figuring out how am I gonna get all these pieces to talk to each other on the front end. It&#8217;s all there. I just have to connect the dots, and it makes it very, very simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m building the site right now for a workshop that I&#8217;m gonna be giving a WordCamp Asia, which is a a shameless plug. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Coming up so fast, y&#8217;all. WordCamp Asia is, like, two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I&#8217;m so excited. I have so much work to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve built an entire voting system on a website where people can pick what we&#8217;re going to be talking about in my workshop, and I built it in the Interactivity API, and it took me, you know, probably five hours. And that&#8217;s me trying to learn some things and mess around with it. And to do that without the Interactivity API would have probably been an entire React-based, you know, completely outside of WordPress. I would have loaded one thing on the page and had it build out my whole application, and now I&#8217;m doing it with blocks and I&#8217;m doing it with a block theme. So if I wanna move those blocks around. I can move the blocks around. I can change anything that I wanna change inside of WordPress the way I would normally, and all that in interactivity just still works. And that&#8217;s It&#8217;s awesome. I just I love it. I can&#8217;t like, the Interactivity API, not my website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But also both. Like, it can be both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> I wanted to say that I think it&#8217;s a great point. I like to think about it like having the best of both worlds. Right now, we have modern frameworks like React, Vue that are used to create these cool websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the Interactivity API plus WordPress brings everything together. Like, you can create those cool user experiences while keeping the full power of WordPress, its management system, the Block editor, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything like that out there. Like having the best of both both worlds because we are still working with blocks, and that&#8217;s amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Given that it&#8217;s still, it&#8217;s not even been released yet. Like, it&#8217;s coming very soon. But.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. This is all still in the Gutenberg plugin. So, like, if you don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, get the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> But just how mature the API is now, considering it is still kind of not even fully released, it&#8217;s only gonna get better? I just think it&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, kudos to Mario and your team for doing all this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you. Kudos to everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, I&#8217;ve a question that I think probably, Ryan, you can start with, but then also probably, Mario, you&#8217;re gonna have some opinions on also. In this conversation so far, we&#8217;ve done a lot of, like, when you want to have these interactions and also when you want to have these cool experiences. For folks who actually do not know what the Interactivity API is yet, and they don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about when we say these interactions like, what exactly are we talking about from a user perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, what types of things will users be able to see when they are experiencing the Interactivity API&#8217;s features and functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a great question. From a user standpoint, it&#8217;ll just look like your regular website, I think. Depending on what you&#8217;re doing. So, like the interactions that we&#8217;re talking about is when you&#8217;re in the browser and you wanna click a button and expand something, for example, or you wanna click an image and have the lightbox pop-up, which is in core now, that&#8217;s driven by the Interactivity API, but these interactions are basically when a user wants to interact with something, what it does. That&#8217;s a really generic way of saying it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Our current favorite example and, Ryan, it sounds like you also have another example. But our current favorite example is like a movie collection site, you know? And so, like, when we&#8217;re talking about what the Interactivity API is going to power, it&#8217;s things like, when you favorite a series of movies, and then you can, and it just updates that on the fly, and you&#8217;ll be able to in essentially real-time as instant as reasonably possible based on your computer and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like, then look at your list of things that you favorited or things like that. Like, for folks who don&#8217;t understand interactive site like, all of us know that that, like, if you get on a site, you have interacted with it. But when we&#8217;re talking about Interactivity API, we&#8217;re talking about types of direct actions users can take. Right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:19] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are just only triggered by some actions. It could be scrolling, clicking, or, or whatever. But, it can go from a simple example like drop down or a popover to more complex things like the movies demo, where you can navigate and the page is not reloading, and that allows you to play a trailer. It starts in a pop-up, and you can keep navigating through different pages, and the trailer keeps playing without reloading. Another example could be instant search; like you start typing the search, and it directly updates the list of films, in this case, that are shown, those kinds of things that happen In the browser. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And Ryan said you, you said that you, like, built a whole survey system, A whole polling system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah, a voting system. So there&#8217;s a series of buttons, each one representing a certain topic, and people can vote, and it tallies the amount. So each, I&#8217;m calling them recipes, has amount of time associated with it, and then so you vote until you run out of time, at which point, like in its tracking it all, and it&#8217;s showing you how much time you voted, how much is left, and once you&#8217;ve run out of time it blurs like it disables all of the voting buttons so you can&#8217;t add more because you run out of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So if you remove one, you can add again. It&#8217;s very, very powerful. And, like, before the Interactivity API, you would have to have, I would have built that whole thing in React, and it would have been one single application that just get loaded on a page. And I just think it&#8217;s amazing. And, like the, the ability to create what are called, like, single page applications or what have always sort of been called SPAs or single page applications where you&#8217;re not reloading the browser every single time you click on a link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to do some things to make that work, but that&#8217;s just available to you and in WordPress. That&#8217;s amazing. I just think that&#8217;s so neat. I mean, it&#8217;s already powering things like the Query Loop block has the ability to move pagination without reloading the page, which is, sounds like a sort of a like a okay, great, like sort of, you know, mundane thing but imagine you had two or three different query loops sitting on your homepage and you wanted to be able to paginate through each one and not refresh the page. That&#8217;s a fantastic user experience that now is just enabled and otherwise was not possible prior to the Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I feel like the Query Loop block was, like, a three-year project four years ago. And I had forgotten about it, which is surprising because I was so concerned with it when we were working directly on it all the time. But yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly the kind of example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve talked about kind of the user thing and people who are gonna build stuff for clients. But, like, if you&#8217;re a contributor and you want to figure out more about either how to use this or how to expand on what is already there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We already talked about how it&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. It&#8217;s kind of experimental over there. But, like, do you all have like, good first bugs? Things that can be worked on in there? Or is there, like, an experiment zone where people can just be like, this is what I tried with the Interactivity API until it broke? How do people work with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would like to clarify first, it&#8217;s right now, it&#8217;s private in, it&#8217;s a private API in WordPress core in 6.4, And it&#8217;s public in Gutenberg, but it&#8217;s gonna be a public API already in WordPress 6.5. So, yes. Anyone can start testing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to get involved is first sharing what interactions you want to see. I mean, everyone has different ideas, and we will love to know the interactions that people want to create using the Interactivity API, so that would be the first step. Then, test it, create your own blocks or site, and send feedback what do you like what you don&#8217;t like. Raise issues, and for that, we are mainly using GitHub. We created a new category in GitHub in the Gutenberg plugin discussions, and we try to to keep everything there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So if you have any questions any feedback, you can share it there. You can also find more discussions about the road map, the change log, many things that are going on right now. And, yeah, I would say those are the ways of getting involved, and I can also expect, maybe Ryan can tell you more here, to start working more on tutorials or videos or whatever. And for me, personally, I would love to see the community working on that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:43] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah. I can, yeah. I think that from a contributor standpoint, especially those who are trying to get into contributing, because, I mean, it&#8217;s not not complicated. Let&#8217;s put it that way, like the Interactivity API. And that&#8217;s not meaning to be a barrier to anyone, but a great place to start is documentation. A great place to start is going through those docs and making sure they&#8217;re up to date and, you know, saying, oh, well, that&#8217;s supposed to do this, so let me go try that. And if it works, great. If it doesn&#8217;t, you know, file a bug, update the documentation, that&#8217;s a great way to get started. It&#8217;s gonna familiarize yourself with the code base and what it&#8217;s supposed to do. And then, sort of, just through osmosis, you&#8217;ll start to pick up more about it. And for anyone starting to contribute to the WordPress project in general, I would say starting with documentation or unit testing is a really, really great way to kinda, dip your toe in the water and not feel too frustrated. And tutorials and demos and show us what you&#8217;re building. We wanna see it. I mean, send it to me, and I will show everyone that I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I mean, we wanna see what what people are building with it and because, you know, just like WordPress, I always use this example, but, like, people used to hack WordPress until we got a hook added for that particular thing that they were adding. So, if we don&#8217;t know what people are building or wanting to build with it, we can&#8217;t make those things happen. So knowing what people are building, how they&#8217;re building, and what they can&#8217;t build, what they&#8217;re running into, what issues they&#8217;re running into is the best way to contribute. So, so people smarter than me can build it for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that call out, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, you know, the theory of tech adoption. And for things like the Interactivity API where we&#8217;re still kind of in the early adopter phase like, Ryan, you&#8217;re an early adopter. You&#8217;re doing everything you think you want to be able to do until it breaks. And, like, I love, like, test it till it fails as a concept of how to get involved in something because, like, you&#8217;re just experimenting, and we encourage experimentation in open source and in open source software and certainly in WordPress. And so, like, it is an unusual thing to think of, like, the best way that I can give back to this project, that I can contribute to this project and make sure that it continues to succeed long term is by using it until the wheels fall off and then tell people what made the wheels fall off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that is a change in thought, But you&#8217;re right. Like, it&#8217;s a very old school open source idea to just get in there and see where it breaks, and tell us. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all we need. And I love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But I just passed my 9-year anniversary being a sponsored contributor, and I was in WordPress for a little bit before it. And so, like, I&#8217;m officially the old guard of us, and so the fact that I&#8217;m, like, so excited about the fact that people are gonna come in and break Mario&#8217;s stuff. Mario, don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s how it works. But also, like, I do find that very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:31] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m willing to see how people break things; that&#8217;s what we need. I totally agree with your reasoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. So I do have kind of, just, like, a final question for y&#8217;all. If there were one thing that you wanted the people who are listening to the WordPress Briefing to know about the Interactivity API, like a hidden gem, a little secret trick. Like, what would it be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] <strong>Mario:</strong> For me, the most exciting part of the Interactivity API is the functionality the client-side navigation enables because there are many, many things there. And I&#8217;m sure that there are many things we haven&#8217;t thought about yet, and the community will come up with some ideas and that would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:17] <strong>Ryan:</strong> For me, the thing is, I love how integrated it is with WordPress, and I know a lot of thought has gone into that without getting too into the weeds. The reasons the decisions that were made were made was so all the hooks and filters and all that goodness that we&#8217;ve had for 20 years is still gonna work. And with the HTML API, the tag processor stuff that&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, it&#8217;s just so cool. It works so well with WordPress. It just works and that&#8217;s probably it for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I work with it, I&#8217;m not having to do any weird janky filtering or stuff that, like, you know, the things that I want to do are not hindered by the Interactivity API. The rather, I&#8217;m able to do more things because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> I prefer Ryan&#8217;s answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:00] <strong>Mario:</strong> It&#8217;s something really important and it&#8217;s something we usually take for granted that it just works with WordPress APIs and the Block Editor, but if you think more about it, it&#8217;s amazing. Like, It&#8217;s what makes it really powerful, I I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For what it&#8217;s worth, I think that&#8217;s true for a lot of, like, the R&amp;D type things that we&#8217;re working on in the project right now. Right? Across Our ecosystem, like WP Playground. It is mind-boggling how progressive that is as a concept, and we currently have, like, you know, 25 ideas about what we could do with it, and we&#8217;re currently working on, like, five because we&#8217;ve got two and a half developers on it or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, like, the expectation that it will just work is there for everybody who has, is not part of the R&amp;D process, but for everyone else who&#8217;s, like, been watching its development over time, shocking. Shocking that it works at all. Not because it wasn&#8217;t supposed to work, but because, like, if someone had asked you five years ago if it was gonna be possible to run WordPress development environments locally and then also just export it and import it into whatever host you want. Like, without a host, without a server, we would all think that you were nuts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:22] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Amazing what&#8217;s happening there and, like, some of the things that we&#8217;re seeing, people who are, like, researching with AI in the WordPress space doing? Equally shocking. All of these things. Like, had you said anything to me about it five years ago, I&#8217;d be like, well, that is a mystery. So, every once in a while, I do have wild ideas about things that I wish we could do with our software. And so yesterday, I went and looked at a prototype for something that someone built based on a wish that I had in 2019. In 2019, I was like, you can play Skyrim on an Amazon Dot using just your voice. So like, why can&#8217;t we build a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then in 2021, someone prototyped that for me. It was ridiculous. It was very bad. It was hilarious. But, also, like, it took 35 minutes to create a &#8216;Hello world&#8217; page, which was ridiculous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, like, what we&#8217;re looking at, the research that I keep seeing from that AI space is people saying, like, I&#8217;m gonna put in a plain text prompt. I need a website as a yoga instructor who also makes custom hats. Right? And then, like, poof. You have this thing that kinda looks like a website with your basic functions and features using the blocks that we have created for WordPress. Like it&#8217;s fascinating how far it&#8217;s come. And that&#8217;s in 2021. It was literally impossible the last time that I was talking about it with anyone, equally literally impossible. Everyone&#8217;s like, plain language prompts for stuff, like that is just a pipe dream. Get away from us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I keep seeing, like, these demos of the research, and it&#8217;s not as far away as we all thought it was. For all these things, Playground, Interactivity API, The AI research is being done. Like, we&#8217;re just a walking R&amp;D group over here in WordPress, and I love it. It&#8217;s fascinating. We&#8217;re just making the impossible possible every day, and I think that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sorry. I got really sidetracked. Do y&#8217;all have anything that you wanted to be sure to share about either the Interactivity API or anything that&#8217;s coming up? Something you wanna make that our listeners know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would just like to emphasize that we love feedback. Please share your feedback. If you test it, yeah, if you think it&#8217;s bad feedback, share it with us as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s especially the feedback we like. I don&#8217;t like this part. That&#8217;s great. We we want to know because the idea is that it serves all purposes for this kind of interactions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That nothing new, but I would like to emphasize that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You know what? There&#8217;s nothing new under the sun. It&#8217;s fine. You&#8217;re good. You should always tell people what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Ryan:</strong> If you&#8217;re interested in getting started with the Interactivity API and just don&#8217;t have any idea where to begin, there&#8217;s actually a pack there. There&#8217;s a Create Block template. So the Create Block package allows you to to quickly scaffold blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a template that&#8217;s part of the Gutenberg repository. It&#8217;s been published on it and NPM. And it will scaffold a very simple block out for you and it&#8217;ll give you, it&#8217;ll show you all the plumbing and how all the pieces work together. So, I think that&#8217;s a fantastic place to get started. It&#8217;s a very simple block. It just basically shows and hides a message, but it&#8217;s all done via the Interactivity API, but it&#8217;s a really, really great sort of, like, like, &#8216;Hello world&#8217; style. I&#8217;m gonna shamelessly self-promote myself at WordCamp Asia. I&#8217;ll be at WordCamp Asia this year doing a workshop where I will be doing some stuff with your Interactivity API. But, if you&#8217;re there and you wanna chat more about the Interactivity API, I am all ears, and I love talking about this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Cool. Ryan, Mario thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a wonderful conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So I hope that you all find that whole project as fascinating as I find it. The Interactivity API is, I know, something that we&#8217;ve kind of been talking about for a while. It showed up specifically in State of the Word, and it&#8217;s hard to understand how important, how vital that work is going to be until you really get your hands on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I recommend you get in there. You take a look at it. I think also Ryan has a few live streams that he does, and he&#8217;s planning on a couple for the Interactivity API coming up. And so just keep an eye out for all of that as we go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:37] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now that brings us to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, it&#8217;s a bunch of feedback and documentation. So, first things first. Did you know that the Documentation Team holds an online monthly Contributor Day on the fourth Tuesday of every month. It&#8217;s just an online docs day, and I love it. So, the next one that&#8217;s coming up is February 27th. We&#8217;re looking for folks to help. So show up, figure out how to get some docs done, and make the WordPress project easier to follow, one bit of documentation at a time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that I have is a request for feedback. So, we announced in December that we have a new centralized WordPress events landing page on WordPress.org, and we wanted to give more visibility to all kinds of WordPress events across the globe. But as always, we really could use your feedback about what is useful for you, what you had hoped to see, what you didn&#8217;t see. So, leave your comments with any relevant feedback about how you would improve those pages and the text on it. If you&#8217;re missing anything relevant, if there are ideas that you have for what could be there, all ideas are welcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, the third thing that I have on our list today is another documentation thing. So, over the last year, a group of contributors have been working to improve the block development onboarding experience within the Block Editor handbook. That contains over 400 published pages, and the effort in 2023 to kind of overhaul that and make it easier was just the beginning. So, it&#8217;s a daunting task. It&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s complex, but improving documentation is one of the easiest ways to contribute to the WordPress project, especially If there are just quick fixes like typos or formatting. Feedback on the existing content, such as the new block tutorial, is invaluable. And so, if you have not taken a look at those yet, wander over to the show notes, click a link or two, take a look, get some feedback to us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

Identified as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw, it poses a critical security risk, allowing attackers to potentially gain unauthorized control over websites running on an affected version of Bricks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Bricks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bricksbuilder.io/\">Bricks</a> or Bricks Builder is a visual site builder that allows users to create web pages on WordPress without using code through their drag-and-drop interface. Unlike other similar products in the WordPress ecosystem which deliver functionality through plugins, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/bricks-laying-down-a-foundation-in-the-wordpress-page-builder-market\">Bricks Builder</a> uses the theme functionality as it’s way of delivering features to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding RCE Vulnerabilities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RCE vulnerabilities are among the most critical types of security flaws. They allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a website from a remote location, allowing them to control the site, access confidential data, distribute malware, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timeline of the Patch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability disclosure timeline is commendable for its efficiency. The flaw was reported to Bricks by security research team snicco on February 10, 2024, marking the start of a swift and effective response. Bricks acknowledged the issue on the same day and, by February 13, had released the patch (1.9.6.1) following snicco&#8217;s recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Update Highly Recommended</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-themes/bricks/bricks-196-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution#:~:text=The%20Bricks%20theme%20for%20WordPress,execute%20code%20on%20the%20server.\">Wordfence</a> has labelled the severity of this vulnerability a 9.8 out of 10 while <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/bricks/wordpress-bricks-theme-1-9-6-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability\">Patchstack</a> has labelled it a 10 out 10, marking it a critical update for website owners using Bricks.

Moving forward, the organization hopes to promote open-source projects and the cause of the open web to legislators around the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of us in WordPress, regulatory oversight is probably a future we can anticipate. If we want to remain competitive in the enterprise/government space, we&#8217;ll need to figure out how to be more proactive at compliance and security and get better at sharing the positive open-source narrative.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The regulatory landscape that the WordPress community finds itself in today is vastly different from where we’ve been. Governments are accelerating their regulatory oversight of technology and introducing new legislation regularly to try and catch up with the pace of innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Europe recently we’ve seen two landmark pieces of legislation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the proposed Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). While both have created news in technology circles it is the CRA that has been <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/concerns-over-the-european-unions-cyber-resilience-act-cra/\">of particular concern to the WordPress community</a> and other open-source projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/Open_Letter_on_the_Significance_of_Free_and_Open_Source_Software_in_the_EU_s_Proposed_Cyber_Resilience_Act.pdf\">open letter to EU legislators in July 2023</a>, the leaders of WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and TYPO3 highlighted the risks to open-source and began a collaborative effort called the Inter-CMS Working Group to bring about significant change to the wording proposed in the CRA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Impact of Collaborative Advocacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In early December, after several months of dialogue, investigation and negotiation, the EU parliament <a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-17000-2023-INIT/EN/pdf\">released an updated draft of the legislation</a> that looks to have resolved many of the primary concerns raised by open-source communities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revised Act makes a concerted effort to ensure that the regulations are practical and do not hinder the collaborative spirit or the ways of working that open-source projects like WordPress rely on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the success of amending the CRA as a foundation to build on, the four open-source communities represented in the Inter-CMS Working Group recently <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupal-association-co-founds-the-open-website-alliance\">established the Open Web Alliance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Alliance, <a href=\"https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/documents/press_releases/2024-02_Open_Website_Alliance/Open_Website_Alliance_Charter.pdf\">now formalized with a charter</a>, represents a collective commitment to furthering the education about and advocacy of open-source benefits and principles. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-2 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1880\" height=\"1253\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654.jpeg\" alt=\"Reichstag building in Berlin, Germany.\" class=\"wp-image-153916\" />Photo by Federico Orlandi on <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/white-and-brown-concrete-building-2871654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pexels.com</a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Future of the Open Web Alliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance aims to promote and defend the rights of open-source projects, aspiring to create a better web. It emphasizes encouraging the use of open-source software, sharing best practices, and supporting third-party open-source projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This collaborative body, while not a legal entity, signifies a structured approach to ensuring open-source software remains a vibrant and integral part of the digital landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, the presence of the Open Web Alliance could be a game-changer in how open-source communities navigate regulatory challenges and advocate for policies that recognize and support the unique nature of open-source development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its charter underscores a commitment to openness, trust, and quality, offering a platform for open-source CMS projects to collaborate more effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition toward a more formalized alliance underscores the WordPress community’s role not just in advocacy, but in shaping a future where open-source principles are acknowledged and protected in the global digital policy arena. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance’s foundation and its charter reflect a mature, strategic approach to ensuring that the ethos of open-source software continues to thrive amidst an evolving regulatory landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Navigating A Regulatory Future: Implications for WordPress Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent developments around the CRA and the active role of the (now) Open Web Alliance highlight a broader trend: the regulatory landscape impacting open-source software is evolving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For WordPress businesses, the amendments to the CRA represent a momentary sigh of relief, but the horizon suggests that regulatory challenges will persist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a business perspective, the future willingness of enterprises and government entities to adopt open-source software may hinge on how effectively the community can navigate these regulations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance’s efforts to advocate for open-source principles–emphasizing security, reliability, and openness–become crucial in this context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth considering that the relationship dynamics between government entities, enterprises, and open-source vendors are likely to evolve. A failure to leverage open-source software due to regulatory or compliance concerns could limit innovation and flexibility for governments and businesses alike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the WordPress ecosystem, this underscores the importance of supporting initiatives like the Open Web Alliance, ensuring that open-source software remains a viable, attractive option for all users, regardless of the regulatory climate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing on education, advocacy, and the development of compliance tools, the WordPress community can help mitigate potential reservations from enterprise and government sectors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This proactive stance not only defends the community’s interests but also promotes the fundamental advantages of open-source software in fostering innovation, security, and a more inclusive digital future.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-neutral-100-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>What do you think?

Additionally, a few questions were replaced or updated to ensure the survey captures relevant data on current and future WordPress topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data collected is used as one of many signals that inform the project&#8217;s road map and  areas of focus, both near and long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights from 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, awareness and/or use of block-based features is up year over year, as well as resources such as Learn.WordPress.org. This reflects project-wide efforts to increase utilization of these respectively. However, positive sentiment about WordPress is down modestly, and more so among contributors. The analysis of the annual survey highlights certain areas that could benefit from increased attention in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the highlights split into three parts: logistics, general trends, and contributor sentiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Logistics</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Completions were up 17% in 2023, though short of a goal to double them, despite increased promotion and partnership with some hosting partners.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Polyglots team translated the survey from English into 9 different languages, the most ever for the survey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Debuted a new platform, Alchemer, for improved accessibility, usability, data collection, administration, and analysis.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The completion rate increased again from last year’s high of 63% to 79% in 2023, proving that investing some time in the new platform and clarifying wording was well worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">General trends</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>NPS* was 30.1 overall, with contributors at 27.9 and non-contributors at 32. The NPS has trended downward since 2021, when it was 45. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>60% of respondents indicate usage of Gutenberg, 8% are unsure, and 12% use something other than Gutenberg and/or the Classic Editor. This is up from 2022 (54%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>45% of respondents indicate that the WordPress Site Editor meets their site-building needs, 26% are indifferent, and 29% disagree.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>61% of respondents indicate familiarity with block themes and plugins. While this question was not asked previously, in 2022, 53% said they had used blocks<br />“In the new site editor.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security, performance, and stability were the top three critical areas respondents considered when building their website, plugin, theme, or style variation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>63% agree that WordPress is as good or better than other CMSs, down from 68% in 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents indicated that the best things about WordPress are that it is open source, has ample plugin options, incorporates good customization, is easy to use, and offers flexibility. This is similar to 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limitless configurations, performance, scalability, accessibility, integration, hosting, and support all saw 100% or more increases compared to 2022 regarding favorite things about WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents cited “too many plugins,” “the site editing experience,” “security,” and “performance” as the top four worst things about WordPress. Most interestingly, though, 16% indicated that none of the 20 topics were terrible, and there was a 43% decrease in the number of people indicating that “site editing is difficult to learn.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search engines and YouTube continue to be the two most common resources for finding information about WordPress, while those writing about WordPress, in general, saw a sharp decline year over year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor sentiment</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>58% of self-identified contributors to WordPress said they agree with the project’s roadmap plans for “Phase 3” and “Phase 4” as a good plan to enhance the WordPress experience for developers, creators, and publishers alike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While about one-third of respondents indicated they contribute to the WordPress project, only about half knew how to get involved, knew about WordCamps and meetups, understood the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com, and knew the benefits of open source.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Of 22 topics, the distribution of the top three things that WordPress needs to focus on from the perspective of contributors was broad, with only a 13.5% raw percentage point (1350 basis points) difference between performance (18.6%) in first position and collaborative editing (5.1%) in 22nd position. This shows a need for more consensus among contributors regarding where to focus resources and/or illustrates that the project has many essential elements with passionate supporters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fewer contributors had a positive experience in 2023 (55%) versus 2022 (64%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Similarly, the feeling of being welcome in the WordPress community among contributors decreased to 57% versus 64% in 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furthermore, contributors feel appropriately recognized less in 2023 (46%) than in 2022 (51%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bringing it all together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 annual WordPress survey participation and results highlight the possibility of survey burnout within the WordPress community and some declining overall satisfaction among contributors. There is an opportunity to increase awareness regarding critical initiatives such as WordCamps and other resources for WordPress users and contributors alike and to increase messaging on improvements made within the project to the CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s planned for 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next iteration of the survey, the plan is to improve the survey’s questions further to ensure they continue to provide valuable insight into the project’s trends. This means some questions will be replaced while others might be refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, plans are being explored to distribute and promote the survey at each of the three annual flagship WordCamps (Europe, U.S., and Asia). This would be in contrast to a single yearly survey. More exploration on this topic will take place in the months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2024/02/2023-WordPress-Annual-Survey-Results-Deck.pdf\">View the 2023 Slide Deck</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reporting.alchemer.com/r/738278_655bbaa5598b14.93675163\">View a web-based version of the results.</a> <em>Note that this link may expire in the future.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>*<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/net-promoter-score-calculation\">What is NPS?</a> Simply put, NPS is a KPI organizations can use to measure how likely it’s [users, clients, members] are to recommend a product or service.

You’ll find more ways to manage your fonts and styles, notable upgrades to synced patterns, a collection of Site Editor and performance updates to help you get things done, and new ways to leverage design tools in Classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will include breakthrough foundational APIs that will start to transform how you use blocks to build memorable experiences. This release invites you to dig into these early-stage frameworks, discover how you’d like to see them evolve, and have an impact on their future improvements and capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excited yet? Keep reading for some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet the Font Library</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially slated for release in WordPress 6.4, the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59166\">Font Library</a> is one of those great things worth the wait. It gives you new capabilities for efficiently managing a vital piece of your site’s design—typography—without coding or extra steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Font Library, you can handle fonts across your site regardless of your active theme—much like how you manage assets in the Media Library. You can install local fonts or Google Fonts, and it’s easily extensible, with the ability to add your own custom typography collections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Synced patterns get an upgrade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reusable-blocks/\">Synced patterns</a> bring efficiency to the design process, letting you make global changes to particular layouts with minimal effort. However, there’s often a need to make contextual changes when it comes to content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 introduces new enhancements to synced patterns that let you override the content in each specific instance. You can choose what content can be updated within a synced pattern—while maintaining the design and layout you’ve already created. Use it for templated pieces like recipes, testimonials, or case studies that use recurring elements to frame unique content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This major release will introduce overrides for the Paragraph, Image, Heading, and Button blocks, with support for more blocks to come as work on synced patterns continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connecting blocks and custom fields or other dynamic content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will finally make it possible to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53300#issuecomment-1938463648\">connect core block attributes to custom fields</a>. This capability lets you use the value of a custom field without creating custom blocks. For example, a digital publication could use custom fields with Paragraph and Image blocks. It could pull information from its individual staff writer profiles to dynamically display on its team page, like headshots and names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">Block Bindings API</a> powers this functionality and is designed to be extensible enough for developers to connect blocks to any dynamic content—not just custom fields. If your data is stored elsewhere, you can easily point blocks to that new source with only a few lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first step in a larger project to simplify how custom fields and other dynamic content are managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Interactivity API gets baked into Core</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as just a taste in WordPress 6.4 with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/51132\">lightbox feature for images</a> is officially making its way into Core. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks\">Interactivity API</a> is a new framework that offers developers a standardized method to bring interactive front-end experiences, or interactions, to blocks. It aims to simplify the process, with less dependencies on external tooling, while maintaining optimal performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interactions create engaging user experiences, whether showing new comments or fetching search results without reloading a page, allowing visitors to interact with content in real time, or incorporating effects like countdowns and transitional animations that surprise and delight. Check out <a href=\"https://wpmovies.dev/\">this demo site to get a taste of what this framework can do</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.5 is just the beginning of bringing this developer experience into Core. Find out how you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56803\">follow along with the work or lend a hand</a> and test more features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get more from your revisions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Revisions are the markers of progress. For creative projects, they&#8217;re also a welcome fallback when you&#8217;re working through a new design or concept. This release brings more detail to your style revision history in the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/01/22/core-editor-improvement-robust-revisions-in-the-site-editor/\">Style revisions in 6.5</a> present a more detailed picture of your work, with design updates like time stamps, quick summaries that outline changes, and the ability to see a full list of revisions made—not just the previous 100. View revisions from the Style Book to see changes that aren&#8217;t reflected in the template you&#8217;re working on. Style revisions are also newly available for templates and template parts, giving you a broader view of your site’s changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect to see more <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/\">work happening to expand and improve revisions across the WordPress experience</a>. It’s a foundational part of the collaborative editing and workflows focus of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Gutenberg project&#8217;s Phase 3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Classic themes can opt into appearance tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the design experience in Block themes evolves and improves, many of these upgrades are also available for Classic themes. Theme authors can choose to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60118\">add support for appearance tools to any Classic theme</a>—even without the use of theme.json. Opting in gives designers and site creators using Classic themes access to a varied set of design options, from <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-wp-theme-json.php#L576\">spacing and border controls to typography and color options</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching themes can feel like a big undertaking, and for folks who aren’t ready to jump into the flexibility of Block themes, these pathways to adoption can help ease that tension. Once a Classic theme gets initial support for appearance tools, more design options will be automatically added as they become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More design tools are on the way</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each WordPress release brings more thought and attention to the way you can create with the Site Editor. The latest improvements to the design experience help bring your creative vision to life:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/57005\">Background images for Group blocks get size and repeat support</a>, letting you play with subtle or splashy ways to add visual interest to your layouts.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56897\">Aspect ratio support for the Cover block</a> gives you more control over your Cover block images’ shape and size.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57103\">Shadow support added to more blocks</a> to help create layouts with visual depth or add a little personality to your design.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Site Editor updates to streamline your workflow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring ease and simplicity to your site-building process with the latest advancements to the Site Editor’s capabilities, from important interface improvements to upgraded tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going beyond Group blocks, you can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54426\">rename every block in the List View</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55188\">rename</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55292\">duplicate</a> individual patterns to help keep them organized. Other notable UI improvements add access to your block settings with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50273\">quick right-click from List View</a>, adjust preferences with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56510\">consolidated settings in the Editor preferences panel</a>, and the ability to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56295\">block toolbar on hover when you’re in Distraction Free mode</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also notice a cleaner and more unified link-building experience that <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50891\">improves link controls</a>, making it easier to create and manage links in various blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release has a bounty of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33683\">drag-and-drop enhancements</a> to make your editing experience feel more intuitive. You’ll notice helpful visual adjustments, like <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56625\">displaced items in List View</a> when you drag them around to reorganize. You’ll also find that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56070\">drag and drop anywhere you’d like</a> in the Editor, from the very beginning to the end of your workspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Data Views in the Site Editor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every piece of your site comes with a library of information and data. Organizing it, finding what you need, and making informed changes should be as effortless as your site editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 includes <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/55083\">data views</a> for pages, templates, patterns, and template parts. You can view data in a table or grid view, with a new UI for toggling fields and making bulk changes. It’s a refreshing and feature-rich experience that leads the way for the upcoming <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/12/admin-design/\">Admin Redesign project</a> on the WordPress roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plugin dependencies improve the plugin experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 improves <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/57545\">how users manage plugins that require other plugins</a>. Plugin authors can supply a new <code>Requires Plugins</code> header with a comma-separated list of required plugin slugs from the WordPress.org Plugins repository, which will present users with links to install and activate those plugins first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Required plugins must remain active and installed for as long as plugins that require them are active and installed. If any required plugins become inactive or uninstalled, the plugins that require them will be automatically deactivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Big performance gains across the editing experience and more</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 contains more than 110 performance-related updates, including an impressive <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57935\">increase in speed and efficiency</a> across both the Post Editor and Site Editor. Loading is over two times faster than in 6.4, with input processing speed increasing to nearly four times faster than the previous release. You’ll also find yourself navigating through the Site Editor six times faster than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loading time for translated sites gets a boost due to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">merging Performant Translations into Core</a>. This greatly improves the load time of translated sites across the board by loading multiple locales simultaneously, making switching between them a faster and more enjoyable experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility highlights</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring that WordPress remains highly accessible is crucial for its success and fulfilling the mission of democratizing publishing. With this in mind, 6.5 will ship more than 65 updates to improve accessibility throughout the platform. These updates include fixes to contrast settings, cursor focus, submenus, positioning of elements, and more.

Even though I don&#8217;t follow sports, I&#8217;m obsessed with the Super Bowl, and typically host watch parties every year. I love seeing the pinnacle of American achievement. The Super Bowl centers around a number of interesting stories in my life, such as when I was in high school and very poor the Super Bowl was in Houston, and they made McNuggets really cheap, so I ate 104 McNuggets in one sitting. (Sweet and sour sauce, natch.) At that infamous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy\">Justin Timberlake / Janet Jackson moment</a>, they needed extras on the field to be their audience and my high school girlfriend was one of the kids in the audience when it happened.

This has been a good stress test for the moderation team, we&#8217;ve done a pretty good job keeping up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to see the submitted photos visit <a href=\"https://photos.wpkerala.org/\">https://photos.wpkerala.org/</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-6535_bc820e-8f\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\" /></div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6535_f27161-0f alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top kb-theme-content-width\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6535_52d065-7c inner-column-1\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading6535_c54615-e0 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><a href=\"https://hallwaychats.com\">WPPhotos.Info</a></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://wpphotos.info/sharks-on-the-sand/\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/40365b3f9f700cfa6.90654423-scaled-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"A group of sharks laying on the sand.\" class=\"wp-image-6538\" /></a></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/author/faisalahammad/\">Faisal Ahammad</a>, shared his story about the WPPhoto of the week:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My four friends and I visited Malaysia and Singapore last September to attend&nbsp;<strong>WordCamp Malaysia 2023</strong>.

So why are tech companies laying off workers?</a> This article has some good data, but I think misses the point with sub-heads like &#8220;Shine has come off the tech industry.&#8221; Really? How is that reflected in their stock prices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a few things are happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, tech companies are typically best at adopting new technology, which leads to productivity gains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI may be an obvious example of this, though for all its hype it hasn&#8217;t had a huge impact on most companies yet. I agree with Sam Altman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1752753792058294725\">when he says there may someday be a billion-dollar company run by one person</a> who is able to highly leverage future AI agents to automate most traditional roles at a company. That said, I think there are advantages to teams including allowing people to go on vacation or take time off, and provide business continuity and succession, so literally one-person is probably an exaggeration. We don&#8217;t need AI to see very small teams being valued highly: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/13/2946785/facebook-instagram-acquisition\">Instagram had only 13 employees when it sold for a billion dollars to Facebook</a>, in 2012!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of this productivity gains just come from adoption of existing tools like Google Workspace or Office 365, issue trackers and version control with tools like Gitlab, Github, or Jira. At Automattic we don&#8217;t use email to work or communicate internally, it&#8217;s all Slack and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">P2</a>. We also leverage our <a href=\"https://distributed.blog/\">distributed</a> nature to effectively have teams around the world coordinating several shifts of product work per day, and 24/7 coverage for things like systems and customer support without the need for &#8220;graveyard shifts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way tech companies operate, the pace and culture, would be unrecognizable to people at many more traditional companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At tech companies some roles are highly leveraged, like systems, engineering, and design, and everything else in the company really exists to support these. These leveraged roles can create enormous amounts of value, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not unusual to hear of machine learning engineers working on ads at Google with salaries in the seven figures. (There&#8217;s been a weird accounting thing where companies put a lot of their compensation into equity, but I think that&#8217;s going away as investors are learning to better account for dilution and employees appreciate the fungibility of cash.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creators are also highly leveraged, which is why <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/joe-rogan-podcast-spotify-deal-28eb5f74\">Joe Rogan can sign a new $250M deal with Spotify</a> (which smartly puts him back on Youtube) after laying off 1,500 people in December. Some people like <a href=\"https://hagenterschueren.com/\">Hagen Terschüren</a> try to <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@hagen/111863148058114596\">tie this together and say you should avoid Spotify for it</a>, but there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a business becoming more efficient to serve its customers, it&#8217;s the whole point of capitalism. Capitalism is, as Nicholas Stern says (<a href=\"https://a16z.com/its-time-to-build/\">via Marc</a>), the best way to take care of people we don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s no honor in keeping people employed inefficiently, it&#8217;s better for them to find someplace in the market where their talents will be better leveraged for society and themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a bubble in hiring because tech had so much money it tried to throw people at problems. But the unlock in technology can come from a single person, a single insight. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month\">It&#8217;s the mythical man-month</a>. Tech-first companies are going to become leaner and more leveraged. Fewer people are going to create more value for society, in ways that will follow power laws and I think we should investigate things like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income\">Universal Basic Income</a> to provide for all living beings. Technological progress creates abundance, where we have more than what we need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> last year we did not do layoffs, but allowed performance management and natural attrition (voluntary regrettable was 2.9%, non-regrettable 6.8% for us in 2023) to allow our size to shrink down more naturally, on average two people left for every person we hired last year, from a peak of about 2,064 to 1,936 today.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Feb 2024 02:33:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Matt: Joshua Redman on Tiny Desk\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=111326\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://ma.tt/2024/02/joshua-redman-on-tiny-desk/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:985:\"<p>It&#8217;s hard to pick a favorite tenor player, but the GOATs that come to mind are Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Michael Brecker, and I&#8217;m missing people but if I had to pick someone to express the human condition and soul, it would be <a href=\"https://www.joshuaredman.com/\">Joshua Redman</a>.

Sunita&#8217;s journey to academic and professional success, with help from the WordPress community, will inspire many.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita Rai at WordCamp Asia\" class=\"wp-image-16707\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A strong desire to acquire knowledge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools first opened in Sunita’s village in the late 1970s, but most locals, including her parents, had neither the funds nor opportunities to complete their education. Over the years, they realized that an education could open doors for their children. Sunita&#8217;s parents vowed to ensure she received a full education, no matter the costs or hardships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her father worked as a seasonal laborer in India and ensured Sunita and her siblings could go to school with the proper supplies. Her mother cared for everything at home, both the family and the farm. Money was scarce, but determination was abundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish high school, Sunita moved in with her aunt in a nearby city. After graduation, she worked as a teacher. One of the biggest challenges was speaking and writing in English, a requirement for her first job teaching at a private English-language school. Her own education had used Nepali as the language of instruction. Fortunately, she enjoyed writing in English and became more fluent with practice. She discovered that she would always want a career where she could continue learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of a demanding teaching schedule, Sunita continued her studies at a college affiliated with Tribhuvan University. She knew that doing both would be difficult, but she wanted to be able to support her family while pursuing ambitious life and career goals. Earning a bachelor’s degree was a hugely motivating achievement that inspired her to begin a master’s degree in sociology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching for more than five years had been a full-time commitment, with hours of extra work at home. Preparing lessons, grading assignments, and handling exams made it difficult for her to find the time needed for her own studies. Sunita decided she needed more time for her coursework, so she left her teaching job and sought work that would allow her to focus on her studies while still earning money.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita at basecamp Trekking Nepal in November 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16709\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From teaching to writing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After an extensive search, Sunita landed a content writing job at a successful WordPress development firm in Nepal. Her salary as a content writer wasn’t high, but it grew steadily over time. She would later gain some supplementary freelance work after presenting at a WordCamp. She was able to help support her family as she grew in her career, and now she could do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I’m fortunate to have had the education that gave me the capacity to aspire, get into a WordPress job, meet people from around the world, and tell my story!</p>\n<cite>Sunita</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in her career, especially in her early days with WordPress, Sunita benefited from the support of excellent mentors who played pivotal roles in her career development, nurturing her skills in content writing, SEO, and general confidence. Now, she has mentored other content writers and advocates for mentoring programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita speaking at WordCamp Asia 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16706\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita has engaged in WordCamps, sharing her wealth of knowledge and experiences. Her first WordCamp was <a href=\"https://nepal.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Nepal 2015</a>, a pivotal moment where she connected with WordPress enthusiasts from various Nepalese and international companies. She experienced a welcoming environment that inspired her to become involved in the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2016\">WordCamp Kathmandu in 2016</a>, Sunita delivered a talk on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/12/01/sunita-rai-seo-copywriting-for-wordpress/\">SEO Copywriting for WordPress</a>, marking a significant milestone in her journey. She later joined a panel discussion titled &#8220;Girls in WordPress – Story, Experience, Opportunity, and Career&#8221; at <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/2018/\">WordCamp Biratnagar 2018</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Sunita helped organize speakers at WordCamp Kathmandu <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2022/\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2023/\">2023</a>, and also spoke outside her home country at <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023\">WordCamp Asia 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://sylhet.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Sylhet, Bangladesh 2023</a>. These events and her <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=sunita%20rai\">talks</a>, helped her grow stronger connections within the global WordPress community and encourage more women speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=900%2C675&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with members from the WordPress Bangladesh community\" class=\"wp-image-16711\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Translating WordPress and empowering others</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and writing in your own language is powerful. For Sunita, translation is crucial in bridging gaps and granting access to those with limited platforms to express and share their passions. When she discovered that she could translate WordPress into Nepali, she joined the many other volunteers on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Translating WordPress to Nepali means empowering my people to access the freedom that WordPress provides.&#8221;&nbsp;</h2>\n<cite>Sunita Rai</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with 3 Female Oganizers WordCamp Kathmandu 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16710\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita emphasizes that coding skills are not a prerequisite for contribution: &#8220;The potential impact you can have on the WordPress community is enormous, across areas from local meetups and WordCamps to testing and translating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights her own experience as a potential path for others. &#8220;WordPress has had a profound impact on my life&#8230; the freedom to work on my own time, to be financially independent, and to overcome my inferiority complex.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her advice to anyone getting started with WordPress: “Get involved in the WordPress community and contribute as early as possible. By participating, you will better understand the project and its people, so you can advocate WordPress in a better way. It will offer you a sense of satisfaction or meaning as well as success in your career.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these open source contributor stories and grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>, or continue your own WordPress journey at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn.WordPress.org</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sunitarai/\">Sunita Rai&nbsp;</a>for sharing about her adventures in WordPress, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Abha Thakor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nalini Thakor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webtechpooja/\">Pooja Derashri,</a> <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meher Bala</a>, <em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicholas Garofalo</a>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chloe Bringmann</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/majaloncar/\">Maja Loncar</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mary Baum</a> for interviews, editorial, images, and reviews.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><img width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

This provides consistency in design across different pieces of content. (…) Additionally, folks would then be able to revisit and modify the design of the recipe pattern without affecting the content in existing instances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In this series of videos, you&#8217;ll see me creating a pattern from the theme&#8217;s patterns, setting the allowed overrides for content parts of the pattern, here heading block, button block und Image block</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I change a few styles of the pattern to make it my own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On three new pages, I use the pattern, change the headline, button text and link and and replace the image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In part three, I change the original synced pattern some more, and the changes are then immediately applied to the copies on those three pages as well. Pretty nifty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s go. <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/playnightly.json\">Use this link to load the WordPress Playground</a>.

A few questions came to my mind. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>How can a developer package patterns with overrides?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How can I modify a theme pattern and not have to duplicate it? I probably can&#8217;t as it has its lock mechanism.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What would a theme developer have to do to create patterns that allow content overrides and update when the theme updates? </li>\n\n\n\n<li>How can I lock down the overrides for content creators?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> also created a stand-alone video on YouTube and invites you to<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazJFdHItTGVXdDV6R3drWGhjX0lqSXdZUW5LQXxBQ3Jtc0tuM01XVmplSEk2Si1KTU1ZaWpTa1lYdFc2NjkyV2pqZ1JBQmZzZl9JVDV1aTNKaFNBdGktd3F5ZlBlUmt2YTVBMzFFQjliUDRCakpzMTVBblFtdi1vUURka0tIak40b1F2T3lnSzRFNV96R1RwbVZrMA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FWordPress%2Fgutenberg%2Fdiscussions%2F57937&v=q53XXJdZXtY\"> join the discussion</a> around how you&#8217;d like to see this feature evolve beyond WordPress 6.5</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><strong>Notes </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the info section of the Pattern list, it still shows &#8220;Fully synced&#8221; (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/58725\">#58725</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I didn&#8217;t succeed in changing the text of the button after I already changed the link.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox has a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how one company managed to pivot towards AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcasts players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Ben Ritner. Ben is the founder of Kadence WP, a company that specializes in developing themes and plugins for WordPress, with a focus on enhancing the front end of websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team have developed a suite of blocks that enable users to do more with the core Gutenberg editor, and in 2021, Kadence was acquired and became part of the StellarWP umbrella brand. Where Ben now serves as part of the senior leadership team. Under StellarWP, there&#8217;s a suite of popular plugins, including Learn Dash, the Events Calendar, and GiveWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Ben provides us with an insight into how the Kadence team managed the integration of AI into their products, shedding light on the impact that it has had on their website building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the challenges of migrating content between systems, as well as delving into the role of AI in content creation and design adaptation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben talks us through what guided their technical innovations to accommodate AI generated content and images. Ben&#8217;s perspective is pretty unique, working for a company he started right through to today, where they have an install base of over 400,000 websites, all of which could potentially make use of AI, but not at the risk of breaking backwards compatibility with their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the importance of integrating marketing and SEO knowledge for effective website development, and how the recent demand for AI might cause freelancers and agencies to think again about the products and services they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the way that the team decides what trends in AI to follow. AI is still new, and it&#8217;s possible that what&#8217;s all the rage today will be superseded at any time. Where does Ben find inspiration for which AI platform to use, and which implementations of AI are dead ends for website builders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the impact of AI in web development and are intrigued by its potential, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Ben Ritner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Ben Ritner. Hello, Ben.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Hey. Nice to be on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, thank you for joining me today. We&#8217;re going to talk today about AI. We&#8217;re also going to talk about Ben&#8217;s history with WordPress and Kadence, which is a product that Ben launched quite a little while ago, but he can tell you all about that. But first, Ben, just so that the audience know who you are, and what your relationship is with WordPress, a moment to give us your potted bio, if that&#8217;s all right. So over to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. So I&#8217;m the founder of Kadence WP, which is a company that develops themes and plugins for WordPress, primarily focused on the front end of your website. So, how do you make that website look good, responsive, fast?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re, you know, kind of in that page builder space, but we&#8217;re doing it from a blocks perspective. So we&#8217;ve got a package of blocks, that enable you to do a lot more with the core Gutenberg editor, than what comes in core. And at this moment, I&#8217;m part of the senior leadership team of StellarWP, which is a umbrella brand that Kadence is under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kadence was acquired in 2021. And so now I&#8217;ve moved in with the Stellar org, and we have a number of popular plugins in our suite, including LearnDash, and the events calendar GiveWP. So, yeah, that&#8217;s me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, great. Thank you so much. We are going to dwell a little bit on AI. In fact, I think the primary focus of this will be to touch on AI, but we&#8217;re going to come at it from different angles. We&#8217;ll talk about the products that you&#8217;ve got, although that may not be the primary focus of what we talk about. But we&#8217;re going to talk a little bit about ethics maybe, or, you know, how AI works, and how it might affect the job market, and whether we&#8217;re doing ourselves out of work in the future, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the first questions I&#8217;ve got for you is surrounding the software that you build. Now, you can go into the details of it if you wish, that&#8217;s absolutely fine. Get into the weeds, and get all technical. I&#8217;m going to encourage users to go to the following url. So it&#8217;s kadencewp.com/wordpress-solutions/kadence-ai. If you want to find that in an easier way, go to WP Tavern, search for this episode, and it&#8217;ll be in the show notes there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But over there you demonstrate how you can create, more or less an entire website. So completely from scratch. You&#8217;ve got a vanilla install of WordPress, you install all the bits and pieces that Kadence requires, and moments later, and I really do mean moments. I think you could probably achieve this in under three, four minutes. You&#8217;ve got yourself a functioning website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m interested to know, why you went down that route? What were the sort of, the things that you were thinking about? Why website building? Why not, oh I don&#8217;t know, just simply block building? I&#8217;m curious to know where you are getting your inspiration from. Because if we rewind the clock two years, nobody was talking about AI in the WordPress space, and those that were, were very prescient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now everybody&#8217;s talking about it. There&#8217;s this landslide of products. And you must feel the commercial pressure to get these things right. So, how do you know? How do you judge that what you are building is the right thing for the company&#8217;s future? As opposed to just, well, guesswork really. Difficult question, but let&#8217;s begin there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, yeah. So I think with Kadence, the decision making comes down to, we were really listening to our user base. And we had a product, we have a product called Kadence Starter Templates. Which is essentially a site that is designed, and has placeholder text, and allows you to import that as you&#8217;re like, I&#8217;m going tolaunch a site quickly. Maybe it&#8217;s in my correct niche, because we had over 80 starter templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe the images are close to something I&#8217;m going to do, or maybe the text is close. But I&#8217;ve got to go in there and edit it, and make it my own. That starting place gets past that white screen of, what do I do, I&#8217;m staring at a white screen, and somehow I need to build a website from this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was immensely popular. We saw all kinds of users using it, from the agencies using it as a, I want to get started quickly on a site, that they had already had designed for, but they wanted to use the starter template because they just wanted it to be built out to where they could edit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we saw, you know, freelancers using it. We saw hobbyists using it. And essentially, when we went in to look at, what&#8217;s the easiest way to implement AI, to make that faster and better for users? How do we make that white screen problem of, I don&#8217;t know what to do next, easier for users? And there&#8217;s a lot of focus right now on prompt based communication with the AI, where it&#8217;s really on, how good are you at writing a prompt to an AI to get stuff back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we kind of just wanted to approach, can we take our starter templates product, and just make the content, the images, and the text, be filled with AI data? Images, we&#8217;re still a ways out from, because AI generated images are pretty poor at this time, and expensive. What we do use, is we use AI to search Pexels, and then pull in images that are in that same vein for what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a good starting point, but is it a launch site? No. Like, there&#8217;s nothing about our product, or even where we&#8217;re trying to go, where we&#8217;ll say, you can launch and don&#8217;t need to edit. Part of it is because AI is not that good. But there is a sense of, are you 80% there? And that, I think, is really intriguing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think, in our minds, this was step one. Ideally we can get to 90% there. Because I think once AI images gets better, and being able to tell the AI specifically, hey, we&#8217;ve got a hero here, there&#8217;s this text , we want an image for that background, you know, we will get there eventually. But as far as like our decision making into what are we going to build, it really came out of, what are people using and like, and how do we make that experience better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you were in the, well, lucky isn&#8217;t the right word, but you&#8217;re in the enviable position, that you already had the stack of things that really were required. And it was just a case, well, just a case, it was a case of tweaking the things that you already had. So the starter templates, and what have you. And that&#8217;s the decision that you made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s curious, because I&#8217;ve seen quite a lot of commercial products come out of nowhere, and they&#8217;re trying to do exactly the same thing. So in a sense, you had a lot of that stack in place, which must have made it, well, again, I don&#8217;t mean to use the word easy, but it must have made it slightly easier for you to build on top of what you already had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. It definitely made it, it made the story easy to tell. Because I think that&#8217;s part of the issue when you&#8217;re talking about AI is, how do you explain this to your users in a way where you can show them how this is going to benefit, and make their lives easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were also like, we know the problems that come with the current way that we were doing starter templates. Which was essentially, we have a dummy site that actually lives on a server somewhere, and you&#8217;re just copying that to your local site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had thought about, what if we broke this down to be a section by section thing? Where we don&#8217;t actually have a dummy site that lives somewhere. What we have is a library of sections, that can go throughout any kind of pages, and then we&#8217;ll live on your site, put those sections together with content, to build out the pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we took the idea of starter templates and just said, let&#8217;s rechange the technology behind it, so it&#8217;s better and more flexible, and then add in AI generated content and images that can be changed on the fly, and are specific to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do have some other AI tools built in. What&#8217;s interesting is, you know, we started with, can we get starter templates, and then we backed off. But what we need to do is figure out the sections piece. How do we get AI into sections, and then we pulled that back out to like, okay, now we can do pages and then websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really interesting to think through where we can go with AI. And I think what your original question was getting at is, how do you choose where to go? And we had a path of like, here&#8217;s an easy story, and here&#8217;s how we can implement it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when I think about, where is AI going, what&#8217;s the future, what&#8217;s it going to look like? AI, to me, is a very good tool at doing iterative work. When you ask an AI to improve something, it generally does a pretty good job. And when I&#8217;ve, you know, in my life, and experiencing with using AI tools, the best results usually come from a feedback loop of, it presents you options, and you either choose, I like this one, or you ask for edits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don&#8217;t have a tool that does that very well. We have some inline text options, but it&#8217;s pretty basic. And what&#8217;s interesting for me, just because of using AI for myself, where I feel like our next realm of where we want to go to, is a more iterative thing, because I&#8217;ve seen that AI does a better job when we go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So part of that decision making, of like, where are we going? It&#8217;s based on, I use ChatGPT every day, pretty much. And when I get the best results from it, is when I&#8217;ve said, okay, that&#8217;s close, but edit this, or change this. And I think that iterative approach, if we can bring that into a UI, can be really interesting when we talk about, how do we build very custom and interesting layouts inside of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So our challenge right now is, what does a page wizard look like that&#8217;s iterative, that allows you to say, I want this page to be about this, show me some examples? We show you some examples, and then you choose the one that&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m feeling this, don&#8217;t like that section, I would like more on this, and then generate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, to me, could get really interesting, in terms of like getting you to that 90% of like, this page is 90% there, and I&#8217;m going to go in and tweak some of the text. But yeah, I think that&#8217;s all kind of how we&#8217;re choosing where to go is, trying and playing with the AI ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It almost sounds like you are envisaging a future, in which you have a conversation with a page. So you&#8217;ve got something in front of you, maybe that was generated by something, using your templates. But maybe it was something that you created yourself. And then the AI is somehow in a conversation where you discuss, and you say, I would like the headline to be shorter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, right, give me several options, we&#8217;ve done that. That image is in the wrong place, can we move that round to the other side? And that picture of a cat, replace it with a picture of a lion or, you get the idea. So you are talking, in effect, to the page. Am I describing your intuitions there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:53] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yes. Although I am scared of anything that relies on us to prompt the AI. So, I do want to have that talking, but I want to really focus on, rather than doing too much of, you can just raw text in, because that&#8217;s that same problem with the white page of like, I don&#8217;t know what to ask the AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to do a lot more of, we&#8217;re going to give you options, choose the one you like, and then mini select options inside of that. Or like, where we can guide that to where it&#8217;s really just a bunch of clicks, instead of relying on you to communicate well with an AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The pace of AI is moving so quickly. I really meant it when I said that two years ago, nobody was talking about it. I have no recollection of it being an important subject in the WordPress space. And now it seems to be almost everything that I hear, be it on mainstream media, or in the tech press or in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow AI manages to get itself in there, because everybody&#8217;s so fascinated by it. I just wonder where you get your inspiration from. Now it may be that there are commercial rivals inside of WordPress, you can mention things or not mention things. Or maybe there are things happening in the wider world that, you know, being where you are now in the tech space, and the company that you work for, there&#8217;s probably tendrils that you can use via that company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s just other things that you&#8217;ve seen in the SaaS space, or things that you&#8217;ve watched on television, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just curious, because I genuinely feel like the whole thing is a bit of a storm, and you&#8217;re being blown around, and some things seem to be landing, and other things seem to, we have a go and it fits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are telling me that the metrics that you are getting are saying that what you&#8217;ve built is working, which is great. But I can imagine that six months from now, something else will have come along, spun the whole thing around, and you are going to have to get, well, not back to the drawing board, but you might well have to reimagine the things that you&#8217;ve done. So where do you even begin to look for inspiration in this space?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:42] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting. I think there is always a fear that someone will come and top you, in such a way that will make you irrelevant. I&#8217;m not worried about that personally, but I get it, and I definitely know that it exists. I think there&#8217;s a lot more involved in like someone just being able to come and trump you that hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We announced Kadence AI last March, and it&#8217;s honestly annoying to me that it wasn&#8217;t until January of this year that we officially launched it publicly. We had a beta version last summer. So we&#8217;ve had our cards on the table for a long time of like, this is what we&#8217;re building and this is how it&#8217;s going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know that there&#8217;s other plugins and products that have done other things, I mean, Jetpack itself released an AI. And that does a lot of inline, you know, editing great for bloggers, where you want to generate content. I know that there&#8217;s other WordPress AI generated page builders, ZipWP is one. Great product in their approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that there&#8217;s definitely different ways to go about it. And for us, we put our cards on the table last March, we had to get that done. And the trickiest parts were getting the AI to consistently respond, in a format that allowed us to input that into the content that we had. And then trial and error, and things like that really came into play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another big piece for us, which was kind of annoying, we had to spend so much time on it, but we have a large user base. And we needed to create a credit system for our licenses, that allowed us to give everyone access to this tool, but also protect ourselves, because every time this communication happens with OpenAI, it costs us money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was an annoying, massive overhaul of a product licensing system, that had to have backward compatibility, and be implemented across our product line. And that delayed AI by several months, frustratingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, as far as like choosing where to go from here, we have a channel at work that&#8217;s like AI stuff. Essentially, someone in our org is posting in there every single day with, have you seen this tool? Have you seen this tool? I mean, I&#8217;m curious. I&#8217;m all in on, I&#8217;m watching the videos, what are they doing? I&#8217;m really interested. I want to know what people are doing, and how they&#8217;re thinking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I&#8217;m also using ChatGPT everyday, because I want to make sure that I&#8217;m really staying engaged with it, and then allowing myself to think, how do I improve upon what we have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think is a lot different than like, what if you had a blank slate? You had no customer base, and you&#8217;re trying to create a product that&#8217;s unique. That&#8217;s a little bit harder to do versus like, here we have 400,000 active installs with Kadence blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do these customers need, and how do I give them the tools? And, how does AI benefit them? And to me, AI is a tool, it is not a solution. And I think that that&#8217;s really important in my mind, in terms of thinking of, how can I use AI, and how can I bring AI into the Kadence world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of interesting. Over the last few years, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that you, or Kadence, we could use those interchangeably perhaps, have achieved, and I&#8217;m doing air quotes, success. You know, three years ago, I suspect the install base was almost nowhere near the number that you just quoted at us. And it&#8217;s been a real rise. So congratulations for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was something that I was going to ask you about, whether or not that growth forces you to put the brakes on a little bit? In the sense that, you know, you&#8217;ve got this existing user base, you can&#8217;t possibly ship something which breaks 400,000 plus websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, you have to get their buy-in, in a way. And I know that they&#8217;re your customers, but they&#8217;re also the people that you need. And so if you do something shockingly different all of a sudden, we know how that goes. That typically doesn&#8217;t go well. So just an intuition as to whether or not you can&#8217;t be quite as nimble as you would like to be, or if there&#8217;s the breaks that you&#8217;ve got to put on. Do you have to be ultra cautious? Difficult question, and maybe one that you&#8217;re not willing to answer, but i&#8217;ll throw it out there anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:33] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. I would say that the speed of development has changed, because we have improved our systems. Which, on one hand, slows us down a little bit more, in terms of some of the rapid releases I was doing early on, when it was like me and no one else, or like me and my sister and a support person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve definitely slowed down from some of that, but we&#8217;ve also done a lot less hot fixes, and bug fixes, because we&#8217;ve implemented more QA and testing. You know, obviously like we&#8217;ve helped that system a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve also done a lot of stuff, and Kadence over the years, that has improved the code quality, and the structure of the code significantly. But backward compatibility is really tricky, and there are lots of times in a developer&#8217;s life, man, this would be so much easier if we could just start from scratch. Because so much changes, and Kadence Blocks was built originally before Gutenberg was part of Core. We released it in September, and it became part of Core in December of 20 or 2019, 2018. Gosh, I can&#8217;t even remember the year that Gutenberg became part of Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we&#8217;ve rewritten product multiple times, to try to keep it up to date, and it&#8217;s always a challenge. And that backward compatibility is always a challenge. And just even, I mean, when we originally wrote it, Grid CSS and Flex CSS were not fully supported as like things that you could use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so like, just even the structure of our blocks were so different, because we couldn&#8217;t rely on some of this new CSS, and that challenge is real. And that desire to just, give me a clean slate from a developer. Every developer will tell you, they would love that iterative, fixing of older code is so hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s the hard work. And that has slowed us down, certainly it has slowed us down. But I&#8217;m also really proud of that work, because we&#8217;ve really fought to do as much as we possibly can to keep backward compatibility, and to continue to improve the code base, so that we&#8217;re thinking future. And so yes, you know, we&#8217;ve had a lot of success, and things have changed for me and, you know, my day-to-day in a large part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what&#8217;s causing the slowdown is not necessarily that we&#8217;ve been successful, as much as all the other things that come into play, when you talk about a product that&#8217;s been around for more than a couple years. And that&#8217;s the, we got to do a major revamp on this code base, and we&#8217;ve got to prepare all these blocks for what we&#8217;re doing in Gutenberg today versus, you know, four years ago, that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Prior to the whole advent of AI and all of that, did you have a roadmap which looked really different than what it is now? Because I don&#8217;t build software, but I can imagine that if I did build software, I&#8217;d want to be staring into the future as far as I could go. I would want that roadmap to be, you know, agile, but at least have some North Star to be heading towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering, if AI kind of upended that, it was more of a case of, oh okay, there&#8217;s this, right. Throw all that away. Did any of that happen? Did you have to sort of retool the team, or take new people on, or just, like I say, throw away the old roadmap and begin again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:33] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Roadmap for me, or generally like Kadence, is usually not too much more than six months out. Mostly because we learn a lot from our users. The users determine the roadmap more than any other factor, and we&#8217;re continuously updating what we&#8217;re going to be working on in six months, because things change and WordPress changes. So it&#8217;s not as long term as you might think. Like, I don&#8217;t know what Kadence will be developing next January. I have some ideas, certainly. Some back of the mind thoughts, but nothing that we have committed to or decided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the main shift that happened for us is ChatGPT came out, and within a month we were like, we&#8217;re not building starter templates anymore. And that was the big shift. We were kicking out starter templates, at least two a month, of these, you know, niche sites. And we just decided then to pull the plug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were like, the future is going to be AI generated starter templates. We have to solve that problem. Let&#8217;s stop spending any resources that we can, on the old way of, it&#8217;s old and we just had released them, right? But like that old way of thinking. And that was, what did AI do in terms of shifting our mindset? It was like, we&#8217;ve got to put everything into getting AI starter templates out the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, because I&#8217;m part of Stellar, we didn&#8217;t have to go to the Kadence dev team, and I&#8217;m one of them, right? And say, you guys who are working on all this stuff that we were doing, we were working on some major dynamic content stuff, some advanced query block stuff, big rewrite of Kadence blocks. We didn&#8217;t have to go to that team and say, everybody stop what you&#8217;re doing, we&#8217;re doing AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were able to pull resources from our parent company, and that was the team. We formed a whole new team to say, let&#8217;s see if we can solve the AI problem. Which I was a part of, but I wasn&#8217;t the entirety of that team. And so I spent the last year, half on Kadence and half on AI. And that&#8217;s probably not accurate time, but like basically I&#8217;ve been on two teams. Then I got our Kadence team involved, as we integrated the AI stuff we had done into Kadence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how we were able to do that, is we were able to think, okay, we have a use case for how Kadence is going to use AI. But from a Stellar level, all of our products could benefit. LearnDash, for example, has already implemented AI into it. You can get a course outline done using AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we went and developed backend tools, and a server that does all the proxy communication with OpenAI, and all the caching, and all of that licensing piece. That was work that a different team, not the Kadence dev team did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it really helped in us being able to keep releasing things with Kadence theme, and Kadence blocks all of last year, while there was another team working on this whole AI piece. And then towards the end of last year, we spent that time integrating it really into, well, I mean we&#8217;ve been doing it the whole time. We had a beta version out last summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you know, that work then bringing in more of the Kadence dev team, and support team, and all of that to kind of get it out the door. That came at the end where it&#8217;s like, when we announced, hey, we&#8217;re going to do AI, there was a lot of fear that, well, what about your roadmap? What about you guys developing this or that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that was the feedback we were getting, is everyone was very concerned, hey, AI seems like it could be a fad. And we were like, no, hold on, we&#8217;re still doing that. We were just fortunate enough to be able to have resources from outside of our brand, come in and work on a lot of the AI stuff. And so that helped a lot with the roadmap. But obviously the starter templates piece was a shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s really nice that in the background you&#8217;ve got a bigger company, and the AI piece, a lot of the technologies, there&#8217;ll be a lot of commonality there. And so if you build that backend, like you say, the tooling that you need for LearnDash, and all of the different bits and pieces that make up the StellarWP Suite. And you can all share in the benefits of all of that rather than, I don&#8217;t know, five or six different companies all trying to achieve the same thing. So the economies of scale work really well there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty brave decision though, I&#8217;ve got to say, because I think, if you were to go back four or five years, everybody was, do you remember NFTs and Crypto and all that? There was that same euphoria, and it was going to be the future. And I think there&#8217;s quite a lot of people who down tools, and just moved in that direction. And fast forward to today, that now looks like it was a mistake. I think we can probably consign that to the dustbin of history. Perhaps I&#8217;m wrong about that, but it feels like that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And intuitions a couple of years ago about, let&#8217;s throw everything at AI, that could have gone the same way. It didn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think it did. It really doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to go that way. It looks like it&#8217;s going to continue into, you know, for the next decade or however. Again, I could be wrong about that. But it&#8217;s a brave decision for you, the company to make. And it looks like you&#8217;re on the right side of history, so it&#8217;s a sigh of relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:22] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I think the fact that NFTs, so many people were like, what is this, and how does it work, and all of that? It&#8217;s part of the reason why you could get on board with AI a lot easier, because everybody could open up ChatGPT and go, oh wow, this isn&#8217;t the annoying Verizon Wireless, or whatever, large company chat bot that I get at support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very different and improved. And I think that&#8217;s part of why it wasn&#8217;t easy to be like, this could be implemented and used, and be very useful. And I would say we did the bare minimum of, we&#8217;re doing text replacement on layouts. The future of having an AI do more creative, and I&#8217;m using air quotes when I say creative, work with you, is going to be really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I think that it&#8217;s a phenomenal tool to work with you. Like, as far as you being able to guide it, influence it. I think it&#8217;s going to take a lot of the time consuming, exhausting work of making this all look exactly right out, which is going to be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I am going to get into the nuts and the bolts of the actual stuff that you&#8217;ve built over at Kadence. I dropped a URL at the beginning. It&#8217;ll be in the show notes. If you go over to there, you&#8217;re going to find a video right at the top of the page. Caveat emptor. I don&#8217;t know if that will be there in the days, weeks, or months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a video. It&#8217;s a few minutes long. I think it&#8217;s you, Ben, it sounds like you. And you are running through the process of basically building a WordPress website from scratch. And I&#8217;m going to paraphrase it, and if I miss a step out here, forgive me, but I&#8217;ll just, for the sake of brevity, I&#8217;ll just paraphrase it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, you begin this wizard, and you enter some basic details. Details about your company. You describe the business, it spits back at you some possible keywords, and you select those. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you do what you often do with AI, you pick a tone, you know, this sort of feeling of how you wish the website to be. And then you go into the image selection process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then all of that gets consumed by the AI. It has a think for, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the right word. It does what it does. And then it brings back some layouts for you. And you&#8217;ve got this selection of layouts, and your intuition says, that&#8217;s the one. So you pick that. You then start adjusting colors, and it disallows, or at least it prompts you that that&#8217;s not going to be a good selection, in terms of accessibility, which is nice, thank you for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you mess around with the fonts a little bit, and you import some pages that you wish, that you think would be appropriate. So you&#8217;re nearly there. You, at that point, launch the site, if you wish. All the pages get imported, and your site is ready to be launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you&#8217;re into the process of tweaking it, and making it your own. I think anybody using AI would advise you to do. Edit with the block editor, go in, use the AI to amend things if you wish, or just do it yourself. And then you can begin the process of saying, actually, this row is just way off message. Let&#8217;s just swap that one out, and just pick a different one. And again, the AI can step in and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that took me longer to say than it takes to do, I suspect. That is pretty incredible. And it&#8217;s leveraging all the different bits and pieces that you mentioned earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this in any way bound to the products that you release? So I know that you&#8217;ve got a theme. I know that you&#8217;ve got a block suite, and there&#8217;s a pro version of that block suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having played with it myself, I can see that you&#8217;ve definitely used the blocks that are at your disposal. But, how does that work if I don&#8217;t have access to your pro suite? Would I even be able to use this? Is this available? Is there any kind of free plan? Can I just pay for the AI bit? And what if I decide that I want to back away from it and, I don&#8217;t know, amend things? Is there any lock in, is essentially what I&#8217;m saying?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:59] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Certainly. There is a free tool. Kadence Blocks is free, and Kadence Theme is free, and Kadence Starter Templates is free. You can get a free account to use AI. You&#8217;ll get 250 credits, which is more than enough to build a website. You could build a couple with that many credits. And so if you&#8217;re using free, you will have slightly limited choices into which layout you can choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you get to the point where you&#8217;re shown layouts, we&#8217;re going to give you, let&#8217;s call it six. Two of those will be pro only. And that means that when we design those layouts, they&#8217;re actually using pro blocks that we have. And so if you imported them, it wouldn&#8217;t work, because you don&#8217;t have pro, so you can&#8217;t access those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use one of the free layouts, which I&#8217;ve already looked at one of our, you know, our more popular one is a free one right now. You can do the whole thing for free. And you don&#8217;t have any cost to you. You can go and try it out. We have a way for you to try it out in InstaWP as well. And that&#8217;s free. So if you just want to like play around, that is on our site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as content lock, and this goes into a really interesting conversation of, how avoidable is content lock in WordPress, and in websites in general? And, how do we get away from that? Because the blocks are part of the core editor, if you delete Kadence blocks from your website, the HTML markup will still exist on your website, because it&#8217;s just block markup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the rendering of those blocks won&#8217;t function, because they depend on Kadence blocks to be rendered. And that&#8217;s how all custom blocks work in WordPress, is that if you have a custom block, you need that code to essentially handle the rendering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is work, and we&#8217;re scoping some of this out. There is work, and Matt Mullenweg talked about this State of the Word, to do more data liberation. Where you could say, I&#8217;m using Kadence Blocks, but I want to convert this to Core Blocks, or I&#8217;m using Spectra Blocks, and I want this to convert to Kadence Blocks, or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue with that, is that there is almost never a one for one with any of these tools. Elementor to Kadence, Elementor to Core. All of these kinds of ideas of being able to migrate out of one system into another is fine, if what you&#8217;re trying to get is the text and images. Not fine, if what you&#8217;re trying to get is a one for one of this to that, because Kadence Blocks wouldn&#8217;t exist if we didn&#8217;t massively expound upon what&#8217;s in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one would use it, if it didn&#8217;t take it a whole lot further. And so to convert these blocks to core blocks, you will lose functionality. You will lose the ability to have the accordions, and the tabs, and the sliders, and the certain types of image overlays and animations, and all of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, is there content lock? Yes. There&#8217;s content lock with core blocks as well. If you want to take core blocks to the classic editor, that doesn&#8217;t really work. So it all depends on what your definition of content lock is, and whether or not you feel like this is the system that&#8217;s going to be around for a while, and supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think, when you look at Kadence, we&#8217;re backed by a much larger company. There&#8217;s a lot of longevity in using Kadence Blocks, in terms of being able to render out those blocks for you, and the focus on backward compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do I think data liberation is really interesting? Absolutely. I think where I think about data liberation is, how do we get, and this is what AI, I think, could be really good at. How do we get out of the mindset of, can I move from HTML to WordPress, or Wix to WordPress, or Core Blocks to Kadence Blocks, or Elementor to Beaver Builder, or whatever it is that you want to move?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we stop thinking about tools and go, you have a website, it&#8217;s HTML and JavaScript? Can we train an AI to convert that to some kind of standardised information? Where it basically says, here&#8217;s the JSON markup of this site. This is the type of content it is. Everyone builds importers for that type of thing, so you could say, I want this site in Kadence Blocks. And we use AI to convert that site into some kind of standardised markup that says, here&#8217;s all the content, the type of content, the context for how that content is. And then Kadence Blocks is an importer for that, or WordPress Core has an importer for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That wouldn&#8217;t still be a one for one, because, again, there&#8217;s just no way you&#8217;re going to get a one for one, unless you convert straight to HTML. You could move it, but you wouldn&#8217;t actually be able to use it down the road. But what could be really interesting is, if you could then import that markup into whatever tool of your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it might not be a one for one in design, but in terms of actually usable, and now those blocks will render, and are editable, and you can tweak the styling. And you&#8217;re that much closer. That to me is really, really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s part of the exploration for us is, can we create a system that exports? You know, where we think about grabbing the front end content, getting that into some kind of standardised system, importing that, and then exporting that in and out of that standardised system. I think that there&#8217;s a lot of really interesting stuff, in terms of just being able to process that and say, could this be a thing that we work toward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would take a lot of resources and energy, but would solve all of the weird platform specific stuff. Today what you need is a Wix to WordPress thing. Okay, like I totally get that. But I think down the road as AI gets a lot better at scraping sites, and understanding context, and being able to create, say, hey, this is an area that has media and text, that are related to each other. And we could conceive of a way of like, here&#8217;s all of the way that AI&#8217;s going to convert that content into a standardised format. And that could be really interesting for data liberation of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s absolutely fascinating. The data liberation thing, really is about CMS to CMS at the moment, isn&#8217;t it? You know, it&#8217;s Shopify to WooCommerce and it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, Joomla to WordPress, or whatever it may be. But that more granular piece of, could I come from, let&#8217;s say Joomla, through WordPress, and the tools that I&#8217;m using inside of WordPress, that&#8217;s Kadence. So, can we go that extra step? Not just import it into Core Blocks, but can we then go a little bit further, because I&#8217;ve invested in Kadence, I know what I&#8217;m doing over there. Let&#8217;s give that a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, that&#8217;s really fascinating. And obviously, in everybody&#8217;s interest, if there&#8217;s some standardised way of doing that, and everybody could jump on board, so even your commercial rivals. You could access it, then the import isn&#8217;t the problem, it&#8217;s the quality of the product that is the reason why people would wish to import it. Yeah, that&#8217;s a really interesting idea, and not one that I thought of, the data liberation thing. Yeah, we&#8217;ll see how that goes in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the AI, the way that I deployed it was into a vanilla site, to test out what you&#8217;d got. Also I noticed, I could be wrong about this, but on the video that you posted on the website, it felt like that was a vanilla site. How does the AI work if, because most people are not starting from scratch, are they? A lot of the audience listening to this, will wish to try things out on sites that they&#8217;ve already got, and push the boundaries of pages that they&#8217;ve already got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I know that the blocks themselves, they can be adapted. You&#8217;ve got a bit in the, you know, the bar that appears when you interact with Gutenberg. There&#8217;s something in there which you can interact with the AI and prompt it, and what have you. But does the whole wizard that we described earlier, is there any utility in that, if you&#8217;ve already got a site? Or, is it just for beginning blank slate stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:22] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> So that Wizard, you don&#8217;t need to generate a website, although you can, and you can import that into an existing site, if you want to. That&#8217;s totally fine. But Gutenberg, we have what&#8217;s called a design library. And if you have Kadence Blocks installed, you&#8217;ll see the design library tab in the backend, like in a page editing thing at the top bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you open that up, we can generate contextual stuff, using that same information from the wizard. So if you are building a page, for example, and you&#8217;re like, I need a call to action section, that&#8217;s a context that we&#8217;ve created. You can go in and say, I want all of your sections with call to action context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the AI generated text that is for your website, about call to action. And then you can pick from the layouts. And there&#8217;s hundreds, we have over 600 different patterns in that design library. And all of those can be empowered by AI, and many of them can be used multiple times. So you might see a pattern and say, well, that&#8217;s a great pattern, that I like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can put about context into it, or I can put value proposition context into it, or call to action context into it. So you can choose the context, and then you can choose the pattern type, and then you can drop that pattern into your website. So if you have an existing website and you&#8217;re like, I even have an existing page, and I just want a section, AI can help you there. Or if you&#8217;re building a new page, and you want to piece together patterns, there&#8217;s a lot of different ways that you can use that tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you can go back through and kind of retrofit, and just swap things out. And presumably, rows and patterns kind of used interchangeably there. You can just save those, put them somewhere else for later keeping. But the idea is that you can put these different contexts in, so that you can modify the things that you&#8217;ve got. Okay, that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the stack that&#8217;s in the background? I mean, I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s OpenAI, because everybody seems to be using OpenAI. Are you keeping an open mind about OpenAI? Now there&#8217;s a phrase I should coin. Because it does seem like hot on the heels of OpenAI, you know, they really were first to market with this interactive chat like capability. Which is very beguiling, but it does seem like hot on the heels are Anthropic and Google, with all of their offerings. Are you wedded to OpenAI, well, first of all, is it OpenAI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:32] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> It is open AI, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And second of all, are you wedded to that, or do you keep exploring the different models? Because it does feel, in certain contexts, that OpenAI might be feeling the pressure, let&#8217;s say. I&#8217;ve tried a few different ones out, and in a variety of different contexts, OpenAI excels. In a few, very niche contexts, there are some rivals, which absolutely, you know, they just seem to do a much better job. So anyway, I&#8217;ll just hand that one over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:57] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, for sure. I think we are very much open-minded, in terms of what we do. Part of us building this whole proxy server to handle, and this whole prompt database, and the way that we communicate with OpenAI. The whole time we were thinking, this structure, all that we&#8217;re doing, if we need to switch to some other system. Because OpenAI changes their prices, or they discontinue doing what we&#8217;re using the for, or for whatever reason, we need to make sure it&#8217;s movable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have experimented with Google&#8217;s, and right now we&#8217;re using OpenAI. But in a year from now, we might not be. And I think that was a key part for us of, like we need to make sure that we have the ability to shift and move, if we&#8217;re seeing a new company come up that is significantly better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, you never know. Maybe there&#8217;s somebody who&#8217;s developing something which is really adjacent to the web design industry, and an AI which is specifically for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what you&#8217;ve built, this conduit between the website and the AI. You&#8217;ve built this middleware, which sits in between. And that middleware could just be repurposed at a moment&#8217;s notice, to talk to the, I don&#8217;t know, the Gemini or Anthropic API. And so, really, you wouldn&#8217;t have much disruption to service. Ah, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:08] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> We&#8217;ve got that server in two different places, so we can experiment too. So we can experiment by just locally pinging saying, hey, use the backup server, and then, let&#8217;s experiment with that. So we have a lot of ability to do things, to test things, without disrupting our user base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that there was some sort of credit system, whereby you acquire credits, which then you spend, in order to do the transactions with the AI. How does that work? Is that like a monthly thing that you add on top? Is that a subscription service on top, or do you get a certain package when you purchase it? Just run us through how that works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you mentioned that 250 credits was available on the free version. You also mentioned that that would probably get you through the process of building a couple of websites. So yeah, just talk us through the typical spend on doing things, and how the credit system works, and how do you top things up if you&#8217;re an agency, and a blowing through your credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:59] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, so we aren&#8217;t charging anything extra for the credits. They come with whatever you have. So if you&#8217;ve purchased from us, you get credits automatically into your account. And if you have an existing purchase, and if you go and purchase today, our pro products have a certain amount of credit. So Kadence Blocks Pro alone is 1200. If you go up to our essential bundle, which is Kadence Blocks Pro and Theme Pro and Starter Templates Pro, that is going to give you 4,000 credits, and then up from that is 8,000 credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We largely created the credits as a deterrent to prevent abuse, not as a system to sell you something more. And our goal is that you don&#8217;t need a separate subscription. And we want to make it so easy to use, or you&#8217;re not really worried too much about your credit count. To that point we&#8217;re talking about single lifetime credit bundle packages, that you&#8217;ll be able to buy for that agency, that&#8217;s burning through their credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going tomake that very, very cost effective. Because, again, we didn&#8217;t ever consider that credits could ever be a revenue driver. We have no plan for it to be a revenue driver. We literally just want to protect ourself on cost. So going forward, there&#8217;ll be some way to buy credits very cheap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole communication and stuff with OpenAI is relatively cheap. That&#8217;s part of the reason why it&#8217;s so usable, so many people are building on it, is because being able to communicate with the AI is cheap. When you take it out to a scale of 400,000 active installs, and things like that, you start to go, oh wow, this could get expensive pretty quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s where, you know, we need to limit some of that. But in general, the idea is that we give you more than enough credits. And if you are an agency, or you&#8217;re burning through a lot of credits, we&#8217;re going to make it very cheap for you to buy more. Current plan right now is a $20 package that&#8217;s going to have like 4,000 extra credits. So we&#8217;re going to make it really simple for you to just say like, oh, top me up, I need more credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just, before we wind it up, let&#8217;s close the lid on Kadence itself. And let&#8217;s just talk about your intuitions, Ben, about AI in general. Now, I&#8217;m not trying to force you to say anything here or to, you know, imply that you&#8217;ve got a certain opinion. But I&#8217;m curious as to what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s two phrases that I&#8217;m just going to raise, and one is that, you know, a rising tide carries all boats. In other words, we throw AI into the mix, and everybody&#8217;s experience of life, and website building, and all of that, just becomes better. And then there&#8217;s another phrase which is, just a race to the bottom, which is entirely the opposite, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering if you have any intuitions about that. Because, certainly amongst the people that I&#8217;ve met, who are jobing website developers, you know, they&#8217;re using tools, much like you&#8217;ve got, and rivals, to build websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is this sort of impending sense of fear amongst some of them, that the very tools which seem so beguiling at the moment, and seem so brilliant because they save a bit of time here, you know, save a minute there, and an hour there and what have you. That all is great, except that there&#8217;s this fear that maybe these tools are going to hollow out the very industry that we&#8217;re serving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the point where, well, in a few years time, you&#8217;ll just go to some webpage and tell it, I want a website to market my cat food, off you go. And, you know, three minutes later you&#8217;re done, and it&#8217;s all finished. So I wonder if you&#8217;ve been thinking about that, if you&#8217;ve got any guardrails in place, or intuitions there. I know that&#8217;s a fairly ephemeral question, it&#8217;s hard to get your hands on. But just a few minutes on your thoughts around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:15] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Sure. I think, if you are a freelancer who&#8217;s building brochure websites, and not offering anything else, other than, here&#8217;s your website, that would be a concern. I think that&#8217;s a valid concern of like, will these customers keep coming to me, for this very simple brochure website, if that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m offering?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that that&#8217;s been going away for a while, and that freelancers, if you&#8217;re paying attention, you&#8217;re probably already looking at, how can I help people have an effective website, not just a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that there was a time where everyone was like, I just need a website. There&#8217;s just so many local businesses that were like, I just need a website. I think we&#8217;re coming to the end of that time, and most businesses are not just saying, I need a brochure website. They&#8217;re saying, I need a website that helps me do business, even these local companies. That is able to capture on SEO, that&#8217;s able to adequately supply a convincing marketing message for someone to choose them over their competition. That represents them well online, and that allows them to be effective, and continue to serve their local communities, or broader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to me, I think if you&#8217;re a freelancer, you should be really thinking about and learning about marketing. And really thinking and learning about SEO. Because what you want to be able to offer is, yeah, this might look like a brochure website, but let me show you how it&#8217;s actually effective. Let me show you how we positioned your marketing messaging to make it effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are running the ability to do social media ads, and everything else. Like, there&#8217;s just so much more that most businesses need, most anyone who&#8217;s going to be online. I feel like, if all you&#8217;re offering is a brochure site, and done and move on, that is at risk. Because I do think that AI can create a very basic brochure site, that someone will be able to say, that&#8217;s good enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s what the majority of, especially WordPress freelancers, are really trying to pitch someone on. And I think that you just need to make sure that you are continuing to grow yourself. To say, I understand the web, the intricacies of marketing, and SEO. And I can help you, not just to make a good looking website that has your content, but make it so it&#8217;s actually something that people will be able to find, and that&#8217;s going to actually grow your business, or improve your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t think AI is going to be able to solve that. I think tools will help you solve for that. But I don&#8217;t think AI, on its own, or anything automated like that, is just going to be able to solve for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting. I think the only thing that I know that AI will do in the future, is be an agent of change. Whatever that change is, it&#8217;s more or less a question of just putting my finger in the air and guessing, I&#8217;m not really sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s fascinating to get your perspective on it, because a lot of the people that I talk to are those freelancers, they&#8217;re the people building websites. And interesting to get a different perspective. A company that&#8217;s building the tools to enable those freelancers to do the work, and all of the concerns, and thought that you are putting into building out those tools. Really fascinating conversation, I enjoyed that tremendously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before we call it a day, Ben, I&#8217;m wondering if you wouldn&#8217;t mind just sharing some of the places, or place, where people could get in touch with you, if they wish to. I will drop the URL, like I said, of the Kadence website. So if there&#8217;s anything aside from that, just let us know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:36] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> I&#8217;m not super active on social media, but best place would be our Kadence Facebook group. That is the one place on social media I will come in and out of. I&#8217;m not a huge social media person, but that&#8217;s one that I, that community is super fun, and I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will find a lot of very engaged people in there. So you can go in there and ping me in there. And that&#8217;s probably your best, outside of, obviously you can come to the Kadence website, and just click on our support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Great. Thank you so much, Ben. It was really a pleasure chatting to you today, all about Kadence, but also about AI. Really appreciate it. Thanks so much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Ben Ritner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/\">Kadence WP</a>, a company that specialises in developing themes and plugins for WordPress, with a focus on enhancing the front end of websites. The team have developed a suite of blocks that enable users to do more with the core Gutenberg editor, and in 2021 Kadence was acquired and became part of the StellarWP umbrella brand, where Ben now serves as part of the senior leadership team. Under StellarWP, there’s a suite of popular plugins, including LearnDash, the Events Calendar, and GiveWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Ben provides us with an insight into how the Kadence team managed the integration of AI into their products, shedding light on the impact it has had on their website building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the challenges of migrating content between systems, as well as delving into the role of AI in content creation and design adaptation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben talks us through what guided their technical innovations to accommodate AI-generated content and images. Ben’s perspective is pretty unique, working for a company he started, right through to today where they have an install base of over 400,000 websites, all of which could potentially make use of AI, but not at the risk of breaking backwards compatibility with their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the importance of integrating marketing and SEO knowledge for effective website development, and how the recent demand for AI might cause freelancers and agencies to think again about the products and services they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the way that the team decides what trends in AI to follow; AI is still new, and it’s possible that what’s all the rage today might be superseded at any time. Where does Ben find inspiration for which AI platform to use, and which implementations of AI are dead ends for website builders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in the impact of AI in web development and are intrigued by its potential, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/wordpress-solutions/kadence-ai/\">Next level site creation with AI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zipwp.com/\">ZipWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.learndash.com/\">LearnDash</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stellarwp.com/\">StellarWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://instawp.com/\">InstaWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\">Data Liberation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/webcreatorcommunity/\">Kadence Facebook Group</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"Akismet: Comment Spam: How to Protect Your Site from Spammers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=283729\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"https://akismet.com/blog/comment-spam/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20903:\"<p>Everyone has encountered spam comments at one point or another, but they&#8217;re more than just an eyesore. They actually scare away real visitors, can mess with your search engine rankings, and can even pose serious cybersecurity risks. It&#8217;s a big deal, whether you&#8217;re running a small blog or a major&nbsp;business.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, there&#8217;s something you can do about it, and you don’t have to go it alone. Today, we&#8217;ll talk about what comment spam is and why it&#8217;s so important to tackle it&nbsp;head&#8209;on.</p>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll also discuss why<a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\"> Akismet</a> is your website&#8217;s best protection against spam comments. It quietly filters out all that junk (without interrupting users with annoying quizzes or buttons to click), so your site stays clean and professional — a place where real conversations can happen&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283729\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is comment&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam clutters up your website&#8217;s comment sections with unwanted messages. Spammers aren’t there to join the conversation but to push their own agenda, which is often sketchy at best. Because there are strong motivations for spammers’ efforts, those with programming knowledge constantly spend time developing new ways to bypass filters and spread spam automatically through sophisticated&nbsp;bots.</p>\n\n<p>Websites and online spaces are constantly evolving, and so are the methods to combat nuisances like comment spam. Google, for instance, rolled out a significant update in<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/10/october-2023-spam-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> October 2023</a> to tackle various types of spam, including cloaking, hacking, auto&#8209;generated, and scraped content across multiple languages​​​​. This shows just how serious the issue has become globally and the efforts being made to keep online spaces&nbsp;spam&#8209;free.</p>\n\n<p>You, however, will still need to take care in preventing comment spam on your own website or blog posts. But more on that in a&nbsp;moment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the motivations behind comment&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam is driven by several motivations, each with its own unique impact on websites and users. Understanding these motivations can help in developing more effective strategies to counter this prevalent&nbsp;issue.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. SEO link&nbsp;building</h3>\n\n<p>The first thing spammers are often after is improving their website&#8217;s ranking on search engines. They sneak links into blog comments or other pages with a comments section, hoping it&#8217;ll boost their site&#8217;s visibility. This trick is known as SEO poisoning because it can actually hurt your own rankings as a result. And it&#8217;s still a booming business, even with many efforts in place to counteract&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Malware&nbsp;distribution</h3>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, some of these comment spammers are out to spread malware. They use those sneaky SEO tactics to get their harmful content boosted in the search results or even post links directly to the malware in the comments themselves. When your visitors click on these links, they might end up with stolen data or&nbsp;worse.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Advertising and&nbsp;promotion</h3>\n\n<p>Lastly, some spammers are just trying to push their products or services. It&#8217;s like those people who hand out flyers on the street, except they&#8217;re leaving their flyers in your comments. They use all sorts of tactics to try to get through on thousands of sites a day (or more), and because they cast such a wide net, even a tiny success rate is worth it for&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these motivations creates different challenges for site administrators and blog owners. From an SEO standpoint, comment spam can really hurt your site&#8217;s ranking. The spammy people you let hang around can rub off and give you a bad reputation. If search engines find out you&#8217;re unintentionally hosting bad links, they might penalize you. It might not sound fair, but it&#8217;s a fact all the&nbsp;same.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The adverse effects of comment&nbsp;spam</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam can significantly impact a website in various detrimental&nbsp;ways:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Site&nbsp;reputation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Imagine walking into a party and finding trash everywhere. That&#8217;s what a website swamped with spam comments feels like. It screams neglect and poor management. Visitors will likely think twice before engaging, and genuine community members? They might just leave.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>And if those spam comments have links to shady sites, it makes it seem as though you&#8217;ve invited trouble right to your doorstep. Spam comments post a real hit to your site&#8217;s good&nbsp;name.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. SEO&nbsp;consequences</h3>\n\n\n<p>When it comes to SEO, comment spam, as we&#8217;ve already mentioned, is a real problem. Google’s got a sharp eye for sites that house spammy content. If your site is littered with this stuff, Google might think it&#8217;s not up to par, which can mean a nosedive in rankings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Imagine, just when you thought you were getting the hang of SEO, comment spam can pull the rug right from under you. It’s tough because a dip in search rankings means fewer visitors and, ultimately, a hit to potential&nbsp;conversions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Potential for site&nbsp;blocklisting</h3>\n\n<p>In the worst&#8209;case scenario, too much comment spam can get your site on the search engines&#8217; naughty list, i.e. blocklisted. This happens when your site is seen by search engines as a place with potentially harmful content or that at least links to dangerous websites. Recovering from a blocklisting is no joke, either. It&#8217;s a long and difficult process, so avoiding this is obviously&nbsp;preferable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common characteristics of comment&nbsp;spam</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam typically exhibits several common characteristics that can help in identifying and filtering it&nbsp;out:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Links to external&nbsp;websites</h3>\n\n<p>First off, links in blog comments that lead to other sites are classic red flags. These aren&#8217;t just any links, though. They&#8217;re usually totally unrelated to your post and are all about getting more eyeballs on spammers&#8217; sites or boosting their SEO. Often these links pose major threats, leading to places you wouldn&#8217;t want your visitors to end&nbsp;up.</p>\n\n<p>With cybersecurity investments booming to $76 billion in 2023, according to<a href=\"https://hginsights.com/market-reports/market-report-socs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> HG Insights</a>, it&#8217;s clear everyone&#8217;s taking these threats seriously, and not just the big fish but small businesses,&nbsp;too​.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Generic or flattering&nbsp;language</h3>\n\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s the flattery game. Spammers love to post comments using vague, super&#8209;positive comments like &#8220;Great post!&#8221; but they&#8217;re pretty empty and don&#8217;t add much value to your site. They&#8217;re trying to butter you up so you&#8217;ll let their comment slide through. And while not always spam, comments like these definitely raise red&nbsp;flags.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1074\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image.png\" alt=\"example of a flattering spam comment\" class=\"wp-image-283731\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Irrelevant&nbsp;content</h3>\n\n\n<p>Spam comments are completely off-topic. They&#8217;ll slap any old thing in the comment section, as long as they can sneak in a backlink or a plug for something. With phishing websites on the rise,&nbsp;it&#8217;s clear these irrelevant comments are part of a bigger online game.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1216\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-1.png\" alt=\"example of an off-topic spam comment\" class=\"wp-image-283732\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Poorly written&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>Spammers often use comments with grammatical errors either to sneak past filters searching for common spam words, to appear more human, or simply because they’re trying to write in a non&#8209;native language. So comments with numerous grammatical errors should be viewed with&nbsp;suspicion.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-2.png\" alt=\"example of a spam comment with lots of hashtags\" class=\"wp-image-283733\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Lots of pingbacks and&nbsp;trackbacks</h3>\n\n<p>These are automated or manual notifications sent when one website links to another. While they can enhance interaction between websites, they can also be used for spamming. Distinguishing between genuine and spam trackbacks or pingbacks involves assessing their relevance and the quality of the linking&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1440\" height=\"714\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-3.png\" alt=\"example of a pingback on a blog post\" class=\"wp-image-283734\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. A sudden influx of&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>A ton of comments coming in at once, especially from new or unverified users, can be a sign of spam. This can be a coordinated effort to flood your site with spam&nbsp;comments.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Suspicious usernames or email&nbsp;addresses</h3>\n\n<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the weird usernames and email addresses. These are often pretty obvious with random numbers or bizarre word salad&#8209;style names. It&#8217;s all about creating fake identities to spread spam far and&nbsp;wide.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying these characteristics can help you in effectively managing and reducing the amount of comment spam on your website. And using tools like Akismet can help in automating the process of spam detection and&nbsp;removal.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why common anti&#8209;spam methods fall short (and what to do&nbsp;instead)</h2>\n\n<p>Common anti&#8209;spam methods, though widely used, have limitations that can make them less&nbsp;effective:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. CAPTCHA and its&nbsp;limitations</h3>\n\n\n<p>While you’re probably used to seeing CAPTCHAs or reCAPTCHAs (those tests that make you do things like decipher a string or random letters or check all the pictures with stoplights) in your everyday life, they can be a real headache for users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"828\" height=\"982\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-4.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA, asking users to select squares with red spheres\" class=\"wp-image-283736\" />\n\n\n<p>Ever found yourself squinting at your screen, trying to figure out if that&#8217;s a letter or a smudge? You&#8217;re not alone. In fact, only about 66% of people get through these tests on their first try, according to the<a href=\"https://baymard.com/blog/captchas-in-checkout\"> Baymard&nbsp;Institute</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s the issue of accessibility. People with visual impairments can find themselves at a disadvantage with visual CAPTCHAs, and the audio alternatives have similar downfalls. Plus, those advanced bots you’re trying to block? They&#8217;re getting better at sneaking past these tests, making CAPTCHAs less effective by the&nbsp;day​​.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Question&#8209;based&nbsp;challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Asking users a question to prove they&#8217;re human seems like a smart move. But it&#8217;s got its pitfalls, too. For one, bots can be programmed to answer common questions. And if your questions are too obscure or complex, you might end up turning away real humans who just wanted to interact with your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Limiting commenting to registered&nbsp;users</h3>\n\n<p>Making people sign up before they can comment is a decent barrier against spam, but it presents its own set of issues. Not everyone wants to go through the hassle of creating an account, especially if they&#8217;re just passing by. So, you might be keeping out the spam, but you&#8217;re also likely missing out on some valuable contributions from casual&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Manual review and approval of all&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>Having a real person review each comment is great for quality control. But let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s a time&#8209;consuming task. If your site&#8217;s buzzing with activity, staying on top of all those comments can be a daunting, if not impossible,&nbsp;task.</p>\n\n<p>In all of these cases, using a tool like Akismet is a preferable option to keep comment spam under control. Now, let&#8217;s talk about&nbsp;why.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The #1 tool to stop comment spam&nbsp;completely</h2>\n\n<p>Because of its popularity, you’ve probably heard of Akismet in the past — especially if you&#8217;re running a WordPress site. It&#8217;s kind of a big deal in the world of online spam&nbsp;protection.</p>\n\n<p>Created by Automattic, the people behind WordPress.com, Akismet has been at the forefront of spam solutions since 2005. It&#8217;s proven itself to be a reliable ally for website owners who are tired of dealing with comment spam, but don’t want to interrupt users with annoying, unreliable&nbsp;tests.</p>\n\n\n<p>What you may not know is that Akismet provides solutions for more than just WordPress sites. Thanks to its flexible API connection, it can work with many other platforms like Drupal, phpBB3, and Joomla. Abiding by the open source philosophy, Akismet likes to say that it’s built <em>by</em> developers, <em>for</em> developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Akismet&nbsp;works</h3>\n\n\n<p>So, how does Akismet keep those spam comments at bay? It&#8217;s pretty smart. When someone (or some<em>thing</em>) leaves a comment on your site, fills out a form, or submits any other form of text, Akismet’s advanced AI program can analyze it for authenticity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>It’s constantly evolving and learning to maintain its incredible 99.99% accuracy&nbsp;rate.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on your configuration, it can set comments aside for you to review later or automatically delete suspicious ones. Based on your feedback, it can adapt to your site for even improved performance (if that’s even&nbsp;possible).</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is all automated — for both you and your site’s visitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The benefits of using Akismet to block comment&nbsp;spam</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet stands out as the best way to block comment spam&nbsp;because:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>It offers real&#8209;time monitoring and adaptability</strong>. Akismet&#8217;s cloud&#8209;based system constantly learns from the billions of data points it processes from its use on over 100 million sites, allowing it to adapt to new spam techniques and protect websites against the most advanced spam&nbsp;attacks​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It has a database of known spam patterns</strong>. It also uses a massive database and sophisticated algorithms to detect and block spam, which is continuously updated to recognize new spamming&nbsp;methods​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It boasts 99.99% spam detection accuracy</strong>. One of Akismet&#8217;s standout features is its high accuracy rate in spam detection, significantly reducing the likelihood of spam slipping through the&nbsp;cracks​​.</li>\n\n\n<li><strong>You can set it and forget it</strong>. Once configured, Akismet runs autonomously, saving you considerable time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual spam moderation​​.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n<li><strong>It’s compatible with multiple platforms</strong>. Although primarily known for its integration with WordPress, Akismet can be utilized across various platforms, making it a versatile tool for blocking comment spam, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/forum-spam/\">forum spam</a>, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-stop-contact-form-spam-on-wordpress/\">contact form spam</a>, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-seo-spam-how-to-protect-your-wordpress-site/\">SEO spam</a>, and various other forms of unwanted&nbsp;content​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It doesn’t affect the user experience</strong>. Unlike some anti&#8209;spam tools that can be intrusive or cumbersome for users (like CAPTCHAs), Akismet operates in the background without adding friction to the user experience. This is essential for high engagement and conversion&nbsp;rates​​.</li></ol>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to start blocking comment spam today with&nbsp;Akismet</h2>\n\n<p>Blocking comment spam with Akismet can significantly enhance your website&#8217;s user experience and security. Below is a straightforward step&#8209;by&#8209;step guide to get you&nbsp;started.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Install and activate the Akismet&nbsp;plugin</h3>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re using WordPress, there&#8217;s a good chance Akismet is already pre&#8209;installed. However, if it&#8217;s&nbsp;not:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Go to your WordPress&nbsp;dashboard.</li>\n\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins → Add&nbsp;New</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Search for &#8220;Akismet&#8221; in the WordPress plugin&nbsp;directory.</li>\n\n<li>Click <strong>Install Now </strong>next to the Akismet&nbsp;plugin.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> If Akismet isn&#8217;t pre-installed or if you&#8217;re not using WordPress, visit the </em><a href=\"https://akismet.com/developers/getting-started/\"><em>getting started guide</em></a><em> for more information.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Once the plugin is installed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button within your WordPress dashboard to activate the Akismet&nbsp;plugin.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"450\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-5.png\" alt=\"installing Akismet in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-283737\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Obtain and input your API&nbsp;key</h3>\n\n<p>To connect your site to Akismet’s&nbsp;servers:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Visit the Akismet&nbsp;website.</li>\n\n<li>Sign up for an account to obtain an API&nbsp;key.</li>\n\n\n<li>Select the plan that fits your needs (free for personal blogs; paid subscriptions are available for businesses and commercial sites). Enterprise users can <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise-pricing/\">create their own plan or discuss it with an expert</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n<li>Follow the instructions to generate your API&nbsp;key.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image.jpeg\" alt=\"pricing plans for Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-283738\" />\n\n\n<p>After obtaining your API&nbsp;key:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Go back to your WordPress&nbsp;dashboard.</li>\n\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Akismet →&nbsp;Settings</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Enter your API key in the designated field and&nbsp;connect.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"450\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-6.png\" alt=\"adding an API key to Akismet settings\" class=\"wp-image-283739\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Configure Akismet&nbsp;settings</h3>\n\n<p>Once activated, review the default settings for Akismet by going to <strong>Settings → Akismet Anti&#8209;Spam </strong>then finding the <strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;section.</p>\n\n<p>Determine how you&#8217;d like to handle comments flagged as spam as well as the <strong>Strictness</strong> of the spam&nbsp;filter.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Monitor and adjust as&nbsp;needed</h3>\n\n<p>With Akismet now operational, you&#8217;ll want to make monitoring the spam filtering process a part of your regular website maintenance schedule. Check in on Akismet&#8217;s settings, pop into the comments marked as spam, and make adjustments to the settings if needed, based on the nature of spam comments your site&nbsp;receives.</p>\n\n<p>By following these steps, Akismet will begin to automatically monitor and filter your website’s comments and form submissions. This automation saves time and ensures a cleaner, more professional online environment for your&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Say goodbye to comment spam with&nbsp;Akismet</h2>\n\n\n<p>All-around, Akismet provides an easy-to-use solution to a massive website-related problem. It works automatically in the background with near-perfect accuracy, and is scalable and customizable for your unique program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">Get started with Akismet</a>.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 14:15:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"Do The Woo Community: WooCommerce Performance Optimization with Sabrina Zeidan and Uros Tasic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=79061\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-optimization/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:450:\"<p>WooCommerce developer Uros and WordPress engineer Sabrina discuss website performance optimization, advocating for awareness, regular testing, and practical tools.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-optimization/\">WooCommerce Performance Optimization with Sabrina Zeidan and Uros Tasic</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce and WordPress Builder Podcast</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 10:41:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:233:\"HeroPress: Words to WordPress: Charting My Path Through Technology and Community! – লেখালেখি থেকে শুরু করে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার পথচলা \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=6519\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:210:\"https://heropress.com/essays/words-to-wordpress-charting-my-path-through-technology-and-community/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=words-to-wordpress-charting-my-path-through-technology-and-community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18834:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020624-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Starting with WordPress might have been a coincidence, but staying with it was a choice.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#bangla\">এই নিবন্ধটি বাংলায় পাওয়া যায়</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey with WordPress started unexpectedly. I will demonstrate my voyage towards WordPress as a freelancer to a full-time job holder and a contributor in the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-i-entered-into-the-world-of-wordpress\">How I Entered into the World of WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2015, I began writing content as a freelancer, not knowing that WordPress would become such a big part of my life. At first, WordPress was just a tool for me to publish my writings. But soon, it turned into much more than that. It became the center of my career. When I graduated from Gono University with a Computer Science and Engineering degree, I didn&#8217;t imagine WordPress would be where I&#8217;d find my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-everyday-i-m-growing-with-wordpress\">Everyday I’m Growing with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After freelancing, I joined weDevs, a company known for creating WordPress plugins. This was a significant change for me. At weDevs, I wasn&#8217;t just writing; I was part of a team that made tools to help people build better websites. I learned a lot about WordPress and how it works from the inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I moved to BuddyBoss, where I became a technical writer. This job was different because I had to explain how things work in a way that everyone could understand. It was challenging but also very rewarding. I enjoyed making complex ideas simple and helping others learn about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-volunteering-and-being-part-of-the-community\">Volunteering and Being Part of the Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best parts of my journey has been volunteering at WordCamps and WordPress Meetups. Going beyond my work responsibilities, I made it a point to engage actively within the community. Till now, I have volunteered at several notable events:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WordCamp Kent 2020 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Northeast Ohio 2021 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp India 2021 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Asia 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Sylhet 2023</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These events have been enriching for me. They&#8217;ve allowed me to meet people as excited about WordPress as I am. It was great to see how strong and welcoming the WordPress community is, sharing knowledge and experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, currently, I am an Organizer of the WordPress Dhaka Community. All these years of working for WordPress paid me really well and recognized me as a community member to serve the Dhaka WordPress enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-i-ve-learned-through-the-journey\">What I&#8217;ve Learned Through the Journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I see how much I&#8217;ve grown because of WordPress. It started as just a platform for my writing, but it became a way to connect with others, learn new skills, and share my knowledge. My career has taken me to places I never expected, and I&#8217;m grateful for all the opportunities WordPress has given me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned that being open to new experiences and willing to learn can lead you to exciting places. WordPress has been a part of not only my career but also my personal growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey with WordPress is far from over. There&#8217;s always something new to learn and more ways to contribute to the community. I&#8217;m excited to see where this path will take me next. Whether it&#8217;s writing, volunteering, or working on new projects, I&#8217;m ready for the challenges and opportunities ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-footnote\">Footnote</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with WordPress might have been a coincidence, but staying with it was a choice I made because of the joy and achievement it brings. My story is simple: it&#8217;s about finding your passion in unexpected places and growing with it. I hope it can inspire others to explore their interests and see where they lead.<br />When it comes to my hobbies, there&#8217;s a long list. I love traveling, reading, watching movies (but not web series), and listening to music. I have two furry babies, Judy and Deany (Shih-Tzu), and plan to adopt a cat soon. These personal joys add another layer of happiness and fulfillment to my life, making my journey with WordPress even more rewarding.

এ প্রতিষ্ঠানে আমি এমন একটি টিমের সাথে যুক্ত ছিলাম, যারা গ্রাহকদের জন্য আরও উন্নত ওয়েবসাইট তৈরি করার প্রয়োজনীয় সরঞ্জাম তৈরি করতো।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি সেখান থেকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস সম্পর্কে অনেক কিছুই শিখি এবং জানতে পারি কিভাবে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসর ব্যাকএন্ড থেকে কাজ হয়। এরবাইরে&nbsp;

সঠিক ভাবে BuddyBoss প্লাগিন ব্যবহার করতে পারবে। এই কাজ আমার কাছে যেমন চ্যালেঞ্জিং ছিল তেমনি ছিল আমার ক্যারিয়ারের জন্য মাইলফলক। টেকনিক্যাল জটিল সব ব্যাপারগুলো সহজভাবে ব্যবহারকারীদের কাছে তুলে ধরতে এবং তাদেরকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শেখানোর কাজটি এখানে থেকে আমি উপভোগ করছি।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ভলেন্টিয়ার এবং কমিউনিটি অর্গানাইজার হিসেবে আমার যাত্রা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস পথচলার অন্যতম অংশ হচ্ছে ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প এবং WordPress Meetups-এ ভলেন্টয়ারী কাজ করা। প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক কাজের বাইরে যেয়ে, আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটিতে সক্রিয়ভাবে জড়িত থাকার চেষ্টা করি। এখন পর্যন্ত, আমি বেশ কয়েকটি উল্লেখযোগ্য ইভেন্টে ভলেন্টিয়ার হয়েছি:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>১।ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প কেন্ট ২০২০ (অনলাইন)<br />২। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প উত্তরপূর্ব ওহাইও ২০২১ (অনলাইন)<br />৩। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প ইন্ডিয়া ২০২১ (অনলাইন)<br />৪। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প এশিয়া ২০২৩ <br />৫। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প সিলেট ২০২৩</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এই ইভেন্টগুলো আমার জন্য খুবই গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ছিল। এ ইভেন্টগুলতে আমি আমার মতোই অন্য ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস প্রেমিদের সাথে দেখা করার এবং যোগাযোগ করার সুযোগ পাই, যারা আমার মতই ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসকে ভালবাসে। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটি কতটা শক্তিশালী এবং কিভাবে তারা নতুনদের স্বাগত জানাচ্ছে, জ্ঞান আর অভিজ্ঞতা ভাগাভাগি করে নিচ্ছে এ ব্যাপারগুলো দেখতে পারা আমার কাছে দুর্দান্ত এক অভিজ্ঞতা ছিল।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>বর্তমানে আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস ঢাকা কমিউনিটির একজন অর্গানাইজার। ঢাকা ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটির পক্ষ থেকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের ব্যাপারে উৎসাহীদের সহযোগিতা করতে আমাকে একটি কমিউনিটি অর্গানাইজার হিসেবে স্বীকৃতি দেয় যা আমার কাছে সত্যিকার ভাবেই অনেক সন্মানের।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">এ যাত্রাপথে আমি যা শিখেছি</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>অতীতের দিকে ফিরে তাকালে, আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের কারণে কোন পর্যায়ে এসেছি সেটা দেখতে পাই। যা আমার লেখা প্রকাশের একটি প্ল্যাটফর্ম হিসাবে শুরু হয়েছিল, সেটাই এখন অন্যদের সাথে সংযোগ করার মাধ্যম হিসেবে, নতুন দক্ষতা অর্জনের এবং আমার অভিজ্ঞতা অন্যদের সাথে ভাগ করার একটি মাধ্যম হয়ে উঠেছে। আমার কর্মজীবন আমাকে এমন এক জায়গায় নিয়ে এসেছে যা আমি কখনো কল্পনা করিনি। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসই আমাকে এই সব সুযোগ দিয়েছে এর জন্যে আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসর কাছে কৃতজ্ঞ।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি এখান থেকে শিখেছি নতুন কোনো অভিজ্ঞতা ও নতুন কিছু শেখার জন্য আগ্রহী থাকলে নিজেকে অসাধারণ সব জায়গায় নিয়ে যাওয়া সম্ভব। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শুধুমাত্র আমার কর্মজীবনই নয়, আমার ব্যক্তিগত জ্ঞান সমৃদ্ধিরও একটি অংশ।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">আমার ভবিষ্যৎ পরিকল্পনা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার যাত্রা কখনোই শেষ হবার নয়। এখানে সবসময় নতুন কিছু শেখার আছে এবং কমিউনিটিতে অবদান রাখার আরও নানান উপায় আছে। এই পথচলা আমাকে পরবর্তী কোথায় নিয়ে যাবে তা দেখতে আমি খুবই উৎসাহী। আমি নতুন চ্যালেঞ্জ এবং সুযোগের জন্য সবসময় প্রস্তুত সেটা লেখা-লেখি, ভলেন্টিয়ারী, বা নতুন প্রজেক্টে কাজ করা যে ভাবেই হোক না কেন।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">আজ এ পর্যন্তই</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে যাত্রা শুরু করা আমার জন্য হয়তো একটি কাকতালীয় ঘটনা ছিল, কিন্তু এখানে কাজ করে আমি যে আনন্দ পেয়েছি এবং যা অর্জন করেছি তা বলে শেষ করার মত নয়৷ আমি আশা করি, আমার এই পথচলার গল্প ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস প্রেমীদের অনুপ্রাণিত করবে এবং আগামীতে নেতৃত্ব দিতে সাহায্য করবে৷</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার শখের একটি দীর্ঘ তালিকা আছে৷ আমি ঘুরে বেড়াতে, বই পড়তে, সিনেমা দেখতে (কিন্তু ওয়েব সিরিজ নয়), এবং গান শুনতে পছন্দ করি। আমার দুটি পোষা কুকুর আছে, জুডি এবং ড্যানি, এবং শীঘ্রই একটি বিড়াল দত্তক নেওয়ার ইচ্ছেও আছে৷ এই নির্মল আনন্দগুলো আমার জীবনে সুখ এবং পরিপূর্ণতার আরেকটি স্তর যোগ করে, যা ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার যাত্রাকে আরও বেশি ফলপ্রসূ করে তোলে প্রতিদিন। আপনি যদি আমার সাথে যোগাযোগ করতে চান তাহলে বিস্তারিত জানতে আমার ওয়েবসাইট&nbsp;

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;<br /><br />[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, it is February. For many of us, that means we&#8217;ve already fallen off track on our New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but not you, intrepid WordPresser, especially you, newly found WordPresser who is still on the fence about needing a website, and I get it. It seems like a lot of work, and even if you shoot for the moon, it&#8217;s not clear which star you&#8217;ll land on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It feels easier to open a Facebook page or launch a new Instagram account, get a channel going on YouTube, but here&#8217;s a secret they won&#8217;t tell you. It&#8217;s just as much work. And even if you crack the code on today&#8217;s algorithm, you don&#8217;t own anything you build there, not the content, not the audience. So if you&#8217;re gonna make the effort to build anyway, why not build it in your space? It can be scary to take that kind of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re not convinced yet, let me give you a few other reasons why you should choose a website over some social media thing. I&#8217;ve got a list here, and they build on one another, really. But the first thing is a website covers the five W&#8217;s: who, what, when, where, and why. It&#8217;s basic information, I know, but it&#8217;s what people need to know when they&#8217;re looking at your product or company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phone book, whether you had the yellow pages or the white pages, those are long gone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the need for that information is gone. When people are researching the right service or product to solve their problems, they&#8217;re getting online to do it. So you should be there, and your information should be easy to find.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us right into item number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people know these things about you when, they know who you are, what you&#8217;re doing, when to get to you, where you are, why you&#8217;re doing it. Having that information increases trust and makes you look more professional, and I&#8217;ve seen that be counterintuitive for folks. I mean, it&#8217;s a digital asset, after all. But overwhelmingly, we see consumers who are well-researched by the time they get to us. They&#8217;ve looked at all of your competitors already and checked to see if you are a human, if you share some of their values, and how you manage waste or, complaints, or praise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can never know who is looking for you. So, making it all as clear and easy to see as possible makes you more trustworthy. And the more trustworthy and professional you look, then number three, the more chances you have to bring in good leads and contacts, which can turn into sales or, at the very least, a sales opportunity. And it&#8217;s important to have good leads and contacts. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you have your information out there on a website, then people can sort of prequalify themselves. If they already have a sense for whether they are a good fit for your product or service, then fingers crossed. You can spend most of your time with people who are making serious inquiries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And coming in at four, you can do this any way you want with words or art, NFTs of your latest work, or video tutorials. It lets you tell your story in ways that other mediums necessarily have to limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, importantly, you can still do those things elsewhere. Right? But having essentially a digital home online that is yours, keep your stuff online in a place you own and operate, then draw people to you through those other channels. Make it all work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have a fifth thing, mostly because I like lists of either three or five, and the list I had was four, but also because it&#8217;s true. Number five is still true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting domains is fun. You&#8217;ve got something to share with the world, and your domain name is title and, story, and first impression. And isn&#8217;t it great instead of having to say you can find me at LinkedIn, slash in slash, etc.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can say something quick and memorable. Josepha.blog or whatever it is you registered. Getting domains is fun. It&#8217;s the fifth thing, and I tried to act like it was no big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also, it&#8217;s like one of the first things you have to do, and it&#8217;s kind of a big deal. You can have your own domain, and it can say a lot for you. So there you have it, some basic and not-so-basic reasons why you should have a website. If you are convinced or at least intrigued, I&#8217;ve got a few tutorials that can help you get started that I&#8217;ll link in the show notes.&nbsp;<br /><br />[00:05:03] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have four big things for you today: four-ish. So, first things first, I have some early opportunities for y&#8217;all to test our next major release. Our next major release is WordPress 6.5. The target release date is March 26th. But coming up here on February 13th, we have Beta 1 scheduled. That&#8217;s an early opportunity for you to provide feedback. A lot of the features that we have coming in this release are big, and they&#8217;re moving quite quickly. And so, if you are already a routine WordPress user, pop on over into the core channel or onto make.WordPress.org/core and get your hands on that beta release. We could use a lot of feedback from you on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I have is that the second cohort of the Contributor Mentorship Program has opened up, and we&#8217;re calling for participants whether you want to be mentored or mentor somebody. We are accepting applications for both. This is a fantastic opportunity for experienced contributors to help other people learn how to do this. And also, if you are learning to contribute to open source and to WordPress for the first time, I know it can be scary. It took me many, many tries to really get started. And so this is a great opportunity for anyone who is trying to contribute in a new way, in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing that I have is there&#8217;s a post up about Data Liberation in 2024. This is one of our big focuses for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A web where being locked into a system should be a thing of the past, and migrating your site to WordPress or around the WordPress ecosystem should be doable with essentially 1-click, and, so, there&#8217;s a lot of work that we&#8217;re doing there. You can find it on WordPress.org/data-liberation. There will be a link to that in our show notes, but also, there is a lot of work that has to be done, not only to get those resources together but also some companion tools to the resources. So head on over there, take a look at what&#8217;s out there. And if you have some stuff to contribute, share that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And my fourth thing, my final thing, is that WordCamp Asia is about a month away. So you still have time to plan your attendance. If that&#8217;s something that you want to do, head on over to asia.wordcamp.org to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

This can be essential for site admins who wish to simplify the editing experience or enforce a consistent content creation strategy by limiting the available blocks to users. Diego explains the methods to achieve this: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li> using functions in the theme’s <code>functions.php</code> file, </li>\n\n\n\n<li>employing a plugin that provides a user interface for block management, or </li>\n\n\n\n<li>using the new block JSON configuration. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each technique will vary in complexity and control, offering solutions for both novice and advanced users.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/\">Need a plugin .zip from Gutenberg&#8217;s master branch?</a></strong><br />Gutenberg Times provides daily build for testing and review. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now available via <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/playnightly.json\">WordPress Playground</a> (no need for a test site) <br />Have you been using it?

Here it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ignite format is a tricky one as a speaker! I will do better next time. My friend Connie has delivered seven Ignite talks now and I thought hers and Adam Savage&#8217;s were the highlights of the ones I saw. (I didn&#8217;t see everything because I was popping in and out.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparing for this sabbatical has been the most fun I&#8217;ve had working at Automattic, ever. It brought so much clarity to things, we&#8217;ve been able to resolve in hours things that have lingered for months, including two acquisitions, several hires, big strategies, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this talk I caught a redeye to NYC to meet with the WordPress.com leadership team and hand off my leadership there to Daniel Bachhuber. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a beautiful symmetry that the first-ever sabbatical taken at Automattic was by its CEO at the time, Toni Schneider, which gave me the opportunity to step in and try on being a CEO, and it&#8217;s an incredible gift that Toni is returning to be CEO of Automattic while I&#8217;m out for the months of February, March, and April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What am I going to do with all this free time?

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, using the GatherPress plugin for WordPress event organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Mike Auteri. Mike is an Associate Director of Engineering at Penske Media Corporation, as well as the founder and engineering lead of the GatherPress project. He&#8217;s contributed to WordPress Core and Gutenberg, is a WordPress community team supporter, has written plugins, presented at meetups and WordCamps, and is a co-organiser of the WordPress Monclair meetup in New Jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve attended a WordPress meetup event, it&#8217;s quite likely that you registered for that via the meetup.com platform. It&#8217;s become the defacto way for organisers of events to plan their meetups, send out invites, subscribe users, and promote future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, Mike decided that it was time for WordPress events to have a WordPress based solution for event management. And so he set to work creating GatherPress, which is the focus of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike talks about the way events are currently managed, and why he thinks it&#8217;s time to transition to something more home grown. He thinks that GatherPress represents a significant leap forward in enhancing the event planning and participation experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the development journey of GatherPress, discussing its current features, and the advantages he feels it offers to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also examine GatherPress&#8217; capacity to enable event coordination, and foster meaningful community engagement. He&#8217;s envisioning a future where event management built on top of WordPress is a hallmark of the WordPress event experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the roadmap features that are just around the corner, as well as chatting about the community which has grown up around the plugin, and how that community is looking for people to help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a WordPress event organizer, or have attended a meetup in the past and are curious about how this could be handled by a freely available plugin, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WP Tavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, without further delay, I bring you Mike Auteri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Mike Auteri. How are you doing, Mike?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:35] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Hey, how&#8217;s it going, Nathan? How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very well, thank you. Thank you for joining us on the podcast today, really appreciate it. We are going to be talking a little bit today about a plugin, possibly a community, possibly the replacement of a service. Let&#8217;s find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are recording it at the end of January, 2024. In fact, on January the 23rd. This is a significant date, as you&#8217;ll hear a little bit later in the podcast. We&#8217;re going to be talking about meetups, and WordPress events, and the organisation thereof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike, before we begin, just to give some context to who you are. You don&#8217;t have to go into the weeds of the plugin that we&#8217;re going to be talking about, but if you just want to give us a little bit of backstory, tell us your relationship with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:17] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure. Currently I work for a company called Penske Media. I&#8217;ve been there for almost nine years, I&#8217;m an associate director of engineering there. I got into WordPress years and years and years ago. Maybe not as long as some folks, but I would say around 2008, is when I started dabbling with WordPress, mostly building some people&#8217;s sites in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, I was more of a front end developer. And I would say in like 2012, I think, I switched over to working in WordPress professionally, for media companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much. Okay, so the topic under discussion today is something called GatherPress. Now it may be a good idea, right at the top of the show, to ask you to pause, and go to GatherPress.org. It&#8217;s exactly as you&#8217;d expect it to be spelled, but I&#8217;ll do it at anyway. G-A-T-H-E-R-P-R-E-S-S.org GatherPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you will find most of the things that we&#8217;re going to talk about today. It is, if you like, it&#8217;s a possible replacement for something called Meetup, which is a SaaS service. You can find that at meetup.com. And if you&#8217;ve ever attended a WordPress, let&#8217;s say not WordCamp necessarily, but a more local meetup event, something like that. It&#8217;s quite likely that you have collided with the Meetup platform, because it&#8217;s typically how things are organised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Meetup, coincidentally I think, came into the news over the last few weeks, because they have been acquired by a company. And at the point of acquisition of a company, I think users often question, what&#8217;s going on there? What will the future look like for that? But I&#8217;m guessing, I have a suspicion, more than a suspicion, that you&#8217;ve been thinking about stepping away from Meetup as a solution for organising events for a time, because GatherPress has a history much longer than just the last few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, if, like me, you are not an organiser of events, but you&#8217;ve collided with Meetup just as somebody that signs up, so that you can actually register for events, tell us a little bit about it, and why you feel that maybe a plugin for the WordPress ecosystem is possibly a preferred solution to SaaS product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:30] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So that&#8217;s a funny question. I&#8217;ve been a meetup organiser since 2017, and I really got my foot in the door, and there&#8217;s a whole other story of when I changed my career. If you look me up on YouTube, you could probably find a whole talk on that. But Meetup is the reason why I am where I am today, by the networking and finding very, very talented folks, that kind of became cheerleaders for me as I tried to make it in as a software engineer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But years ago when I was an organiser, one of the folks that attended said, why don&#8217;t we just build something on WordPress? And at that time I thought it was blasphemy, I&#8217;m like, that would never work. We need discoverability for a meetup, no one would ever find us, that just can&#8217;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Couple years later, a little thing called the dashboard widget appeared in WordPress, which started promoting meetups and WordCamps. And I&#8217;ll tell you like, once that hit WordPress, our numbers went through the roof. People were finding us left and right through the dashboard widget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one of the reasons why I think, for the last couple years, we could have been able to move off of Meetup, or at least been less reliant on it, is because of that dashboard widget. Most of the folks that I speak to, that attend to our meetups, find us through the dashboard widget. Less of them find us through meetup.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that&#8217;s anecdotal, and I&#8217;m sure there is data to back this up that I don&#8217;t have, but I&#8217;ve spoken to other organisers, and I hear similar stories, that I think we get higher quality folks. And what I mean by that is people that actually show up, that sign up and show up to a meetup from the dashboard widget, than we do from the discoverability of meetup.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a really credible answer. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve got anything more you want to add, but certainly that does help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:12] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. I&#8217;ll stay with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so I guess we should paint some context around that. So Meetup is in no way connected with WordPress, other than the fact that it is used by the WordPress community. You don&#8217;t have to have a WordPress event in order to use Meetup. It could be for literally any kind of event. You can sign up as anybody out there, and set up any kind of event. So your local history council, or something like that could be using Meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I suppose, back in the day, there was almost like this SEO piece, where you wanted discoverability, you wanted the fact that your local meetup was going to be taking place this Tuesday to be announced globally. And shouting into the void was very hard, and so having people come through a platform where they&#8217;ve already signed up, and they&#8217;ve already got themselves an account, and the platform knew more about where they lived and all that was quite useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it sounds like what you are saying is, that because it&#8217;s a generic platform, and you could be signed up for all sorts of reasons, people might have signed up to the actual event on Tuesday, or Thursday, or whatever, you know, next month, that actual real world event. But then didn&#8217;t kind of follow through, because they really weren&#8217;t in the WordPress ecosystem, they just collided with it by accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then this dashboard widget comes along. Every single instance of WordPress has it, whether it&#8217;s visible or not is up to you. But it says, you know, it tells you what&#8217;s going on and where. And maybe there&#8217;s more of a hot lead feel to those people, because they&#8217;re actually interacting with WordPress, not just the platform. Have I encapsulated that about right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:39] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I kind of get in the head of someone that would see the dashboard widget. You think about someone that just started their business, and put up their WordPress site and they&#8217;re like, now what? And they&#8217;re sitting in the admin, not sure what to do next. And the first thing they see is a meetup that is meeting next week, that&#8217;s like a mile away from their house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is powerful. Thinking like, wow, I can get help, because I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing here. And we see a lot of folks like that. They come to, especially our help desks, a lot of DIY people. People that are starting businesses. They&#8217;re not sure how to get started, but they see that dashboard widget. And that was an incredible addition to WordPress, and to expanding our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the Meetup platform has really great uses. You know, this is not an exercise in taking Meetup apart. It&#8217;s more an exercise in, well, given that there&#8217;s a bunch of software engineers behind the WordPress project, and there&#8217;s a plugin architecture, why not explore the options to create it inside of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that really is what GatherPress is aiming to do. It&#8217;s aiming to give you, dear listener, the opportunity to download a plugin, and organise your meeting within your WordPress admin. And now obviously you could set up a, you know, a unique domain, or you could set up something in a website that you already have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, do you just want to run through, maybe the more philosophical position, the open source position? Why do you feel it&#8217;s a good idea to have this as a plugin? What is it that you feel it brings as a plugin, as opposed to the service which we&#8217;ve been using until now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:11] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure. You know, we&#8217;re kind of alluding to it. You know, WordPress is an open source community, and has some incredibly talented folks. And this isn&#8217;t really breaking new ground in a lot of ways. There are event management plugins out there, there are plenty of them, and some of them have whole businesses around their event management plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I am after though, is one that stays true to the WordPress community&#8217;s roadmap of what they would want to see for an event management plugin. Meetup is the odd one out, when you think of the infrastructure that is of the WordPress community. If you look at wordpress.org, wordcamp.org, wordpress.tv, even wordpress.com, they&#8217;re all powered by WordPress. They&#8217;re all services. They&#8217;re all supporting the community using the software that we work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The odd one out is meetup.com, and there was a reason for it originally. And there is still a reason to have it there now, but I think we could start exploring the idea of, what if meetups were powered by WordPress? What are the advantages? And I feel like there are lots of advantages. Think about, you mentioned with meetup.com before is, it&#8217;s very general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we&#8217;re being more specific with say, a community run multi-site, if you think of like how WordCamps function, a large WordPress multi-site, that.org stands up. If we did the same thing for Meetup, we could promote other meetups within meetups. We can promote WordCamps within meetups, say in sidebars. We can promote learning materials. We have full control over the content, and how it&#8217;s placed, and where it&#8217;s placed, in order to best educate and help the folks that are landing on this type of meetup page that&#8217;s powered by WordPress, and what they know is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we&#8217;d be able to really draw people into the WordPress community a lot sooner, by using something that&#8217;s powered by WordPress, as opposed to something on meetup.com, where they think, maybe, the WordPress community goes as far as their local meetup. They won&#8217;t know that like, right off the bat, that WordPress is global, that WordCamps are huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been to like WordCamp US or WordCamp Europe, these are very, very large. Like especially when people only have a local view, and they&#8217;re like, oh yeah, WordCamp US, that&#8217;s three hours from my house, I think I&#8217;ll go. People are amazed at how large, and how extensive the community is. By being able to do something that&#8217;s powered by WordPress, we&#8217;d be able to do that a lot sooner for those folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Has your North Star, whilst you&#8217;ve been creating this, been more or less direct replacement for the feature set that Meetup offers? I guess what I&#8217;m introducing here is, tell us a little bit about the functionality that you have shipped thus far. We can get onto roadmap features and things like that in the future. I was curious if the intention of the GatherPress plugin and project, is to literally have a replacement for meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, is the WordPress meetup format the North Star? You know, the intention is it&#8217;ll achieve all of those things. But it&#8217;s not intended to be a more general plugin for anybody else. You know, it&#8217;s specifically created to replicate live events for WordPress. What you&#8217;re thinking there, really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:26] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. I absolutely used meetup.com as an example. They&#8217;ve been doing this for years, so I want to make sure that we had the features, especially the important features that matter to the WordPress community as far as I could tell. Because, like I said, I&#8217;ve been a WordPress meetup organiser since 2017. Making sure that all those features are there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I think of myself as a WordPress organiser, I&#8217;m like, okay, if I was to do something powered by WordPress, what would this thing need to do, in order for me to be like, yeah, I could use this instead of meetup.com? So I kind of use that as my starting place. And as I mentioned before, like, we started working on this in 2019. And it&#8217;s kind of evolved since then. It&#8217;s not really the same thing it was when it started. I would say it probably became stable about two years ago of like, okay, this is exactly what we&#8217;re building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve had other folks that have jumped onto the project, and giving their insights as well. Some as, you know, people that attended meetups, some people that were also organisers, and trying to build the feature set that we would expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we started this, blocks were pretty new. Like I said, 2019, so blocks were still pretty new at that point. And I wanted to build this to be very forward thinking, and be like, this is going to leverage all the great stuff that has been coming out of core around blocks, making it easy for folks to come in and use the GatherPress blocks in order to RSVP, see a list of people that have RSVP&#8217;d. Add to calendar block, a specific date block for scheduling. All these features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also looked at the event manager plugin, as another idea of that&#8217;s a popular, not quite exactly what I was looking at, but still an event management plugin. And seeing the ways they translated these things into WordPress, and took what I thought would be a good user interface. And, you know, between the two of those, started building GatherPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you mentioned there, blocks. So, is that the primary interface for interacting? You set up a post, or a page, or whatever it may be, and you&#8217;re dragging blocks in, which I guess are adjacent to certain features. So you may drag one in that is a GatherPress block, and it asks you for, you know, when do you want to put this event on? Where exactly is it located? And all that kind of stuff. And then it will present that data on the front end. Have I got that roughly correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:49] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah, roughly, like we make it a little bit easier with block templates, for the event itself. So, I mean, granted you can, you know, move the blocks around all you want, but it&#8217;ll start you off with a block placement that makes sense. So someone that is a little less savvy, will know where to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have, in addition to events, we also have the ability to add and create venues, and tie those venues to the events. All of those are post types, venues actually, a mixture of a post type and a taxonomy. I won&#8217;t get into the technical aspect of that, but it&#8217;s pretty neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have various settings within the GatherPress plugin to customise how you want your event to look. And I have to hand it to Patricia, she played a huge role in this, because I came at this from a very American point of view. And she was mentioning to me, I want to change the date format. I&#8217;m like, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we start building settings for changing date formats and, you know, exploring all the different ways we need to translate the plugin. And we actually translated into a few languages already, which is pretty cool. And a lot of it was helped from her and Javier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the intention really is for non-technical users to be able to download the plugin, follow some basic data entry, you know, dates, times, map locations, that kind of thing. Perhaps internationalise it in some way, and then click publish and you&#8217;re off to the races. You&#8217;ll have something on the front end that people can see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess you&#8217;ve got two markets for this. You&#8217;ve got to be thinking about how the people wishing to attend the event are going to be interacting, and what you&#8217;ll do with that data. But you&#8217;ve also got to make sure it&#8217;s nice and straightforward for the people who are organising the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so let&#8217;s talk about those two different roles a little bit. What features do you bring, let&#8217;s begin with the, I&#8217;m an event organiser. What features do you bring to enable me to do that? You know, you mentioned these blocks, and that you can say what the title of the event is, and bind it to a location, and all of that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But does it offer me functionality to, for example, see a list of who&#8217;s signed up for this particular event, see a list of who&#8217;s cancelled? I don&#8217;t know, in some way communicate with them, email the people who have responded, but haven&#8217;t got involved in that event yet. All those kind of things that we might see in a dedicated SaaS app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:03] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure, yeah. So a few of those features are in their infancy. Like, one of our big things was, what do we need for a minimum viable product for this plugin? So we&#8217;ve been focusing on that. So some of this stuff isn&#8217;t quite there yet, but a lot of it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have, so for instance, an RSVP response block. So if you go to the event, and you are logged in, you can click on the RSVP button, and say you&#8217;re attending. Once you click on that attending, in real time, it shows you that you are now in the attendance list. Kind of like how Meetup functions, in a lot of ways. So if you go to meetup.com, a new event is there, you say, yeah, I&#8217;m going to go, and you click attend, now you&#8217;re on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So everybody can see that you are now attending. You would also change it to be not attending, and you will then be in a list of folks that are not attending, if you change your mind and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody&#8217;s able to see that. These are all different blocks that are within the event post type. They also tie in with some, getting a little bit more technical, tie into database tables and such, in order to store that data. So they&#8217;re not stored in the block, they&#8217;re stored in the database, and are represented in that block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have not added a feature yet to it, but this is in our next release. We&#8217;re currently at 0.27. In 0.28, we are working on an admin interface, for an administrator to be able to remove or add people to a list, like automatically from that block. We have not finished that yet, but that is in progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also adding a feature, so if people can list themselves anonymously that they&#8217;re attending. So if they don&#8217;t want their name or profile photo to show up, they can be anonymous. They&#8217;ll be anonymous to everybody other than administrators, administrators will know who&#8217;s showing up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not a feature of meetup.com, but that is a feature that folks that I&#8217;ve heard from in the WordPress community, actually I think Courtney was one of the ones that mentioned it. Some people want to just show up and not, you know, people to know who they are. And we do have that feature also in WordCamps, for folks that don&#8217;t want to be shown as listed, that they&#8217;re attending a WordCamp for privacy reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When you attend a WordCamp, like WordCamp US, one of the options at the point of purchasing the ticket is to, I guess it&#8217;s the same thing. It&#8217;s not really anonymous in the same way, but you just don&#8217;t appear on the website. You just decline to be on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:18] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. So in GatherPress, and it&#8217;s kind of the same way, instead of a display name, it&#8217;ll say anonymous. And instead of a photo, it&#8217;ll show like a, you know, the generic avatar listed. So it will show that someone is attending, but it won&#8217;t show who.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. You&#8217;re able as the administrator of the event, the organiser of the event, to communicate with these people? Is there a fairly straight forward way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:37] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. So we do have, and this is, again, still in its infancy, we have the ability to compose messages, and send to people in the community. You can have a couple of check boxes that say, contact all members, people that are attending, people that are on the wait list, we do have a wait list feature, and people that are not attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So between these check boxes, you can click on a button that pulls up a modal in the admin, write your message, hit send, and that&#8217;ll send out an email to the designated folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you don&#8217;t mind me sort of interrupting that point, how are you handling email? Do you have connections with certain SMTP services, or is that just something else you have to handle elsewhere, possibly with a plugin? And do you queue the emails so they go in batches, or, what&#8217;s the intention there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:21] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So it&#8217;s using wp_mail, which is the, you know, underneath the layer of everything is kind of a generic email. By default you will use PHP mail. You can use the WP SMTP plugin, which we are using on gatherpress.org, to set it up with a certain service in order to have deliverability, what you want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I am always thinking about, with this plugin in particular, it&#8217;s like we don&#8217;t want to do too much. There&#8217;s plenty of plugins that do a thing better than we would do it. And we should use those plugins, verses trying to duplicate a feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, one of my other thoughts is like, say BuddyPress. BuddyPress has a lot of community features to it. It would be great to use GatherPress and BuddyPress, and making sure the two play nice together, and integrate well together. And not have things in GatherPress do things that BuddyPress could do better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same instance, we just want to send emails. And whatever service you want to use, a plugin to handle your service, that&#8217;s what you should do. And we&#8217;re not going to be too opinionated about that. We will just make sure that we send it through WP Mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, yeah. But in terms of the administration of the event, do you have options to, I don&#8217;t know, recycle events? So you&#8217;ve run a very successful event, everything that you&#8217;d set up on a previous event checked out, you&#8217;re really happy with the way it was. Have you got options to, more or less, duplicate that event, and carry on from there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:44] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Currently that&#8217;s on the roadmap. Being able to have a recurring event is, we do have a ticket in our backlog that did not make it into the MVP, because that, as you can imagine, is a bit more complicated. I do have a plan for it. So I do have an architecture and plan that I&#8217;m putting together. But it is not in the core plugin yet. Currently, like, for say, our current GatherPress events, I think it&#8217;s called Duplicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Duplicate Post, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:11] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Duplicate Post, yeah. I just use that, because we have the same weekly huddle. Every week I just clone it, put in the new date, and publish. So it&#8217;s one more step than having something that would be recurring. But it&#8217;s not that bad, and that kind of works for now. And that&#8217;s kind of what we&#8217;re using until that feature is built. And that is definitely on our roadmap though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Lovely. And of course, we know what happened during the last four years or so. Covid came, all the events went away, and we were forced into Zoom and online events. And some of those are still happening, some of the events haven&#8217;t come back in the real world. Is there any options in there to, you know, not use the map and to, I don&#8217;t know, bind it to a Zoom link and an online event, something along those lines?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Absolutely. So that was absolutely in our MVP, because we were building this during Covid, so that was front and center of our thinking. And a lot of time went into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our venue options, so if you&#8217;re creating an event, an online event is automatically there, since an online event is just an online event, and it doesn&#8217;t require a map, it doesn&#8217;t require any specifics, it&#8217;s just online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you select that, it gives you an option to add, say, a Zoom link, or Google Meet, or Teams, or whatever you&#8217;re hosting your online meetup at. A recent feature we put into this is that the online link, or the Zoom link, or whatever it is, will not be available until five minutes before the event starts. So you don&#8217;t have people like jumping in there when they&#8217;re not supposed to be, and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was a feature we added, that&#8217;s actually not on Meetup. Meetup, you see that online link. But we added a feature that will kind of hide the event link. And when I mean hide, I mean hide hide, like it&#8217;s not in APIs and any of that fun stuff. So it&#8217;s pretty well, behind closed doors at that point. But it becomes available once you&#8217;re logged in, and five minutes before the event. That&#8217;s kind of how we set it for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So as an admin, all of that makes perfect sense. It sounds really straightforward and simple. There are some videos, by the way, on the GatherPress website. So you can go and check out the UI, and everything we&#8217;ve just described is there, visible for you to see, there&#8217;s a nice run through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, from the end user&#8217;s point of view, the person who&#8217;s attending the event, I guess it&#8217;s just a case of discovering the website, going there, entering an email address, and confirming a link, or something like that. And of course, given that your block is showing data, I guess you can, as the admin, you can modify where that&#8217;s displayed. And you can pad it with other content with different blocks, you know, if you want to add something before it and after it, you can do all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is that basically it? I show up to your website, I enter an email address, and from that point on, I&#8217;m expecting email to arrive, and then to attend the event itself. Can that happen online, if it is an online event? Do you have the option to do that? Or, have you got to go your own way there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:01] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> The way it would function, from an end user&#8217;s point of view, if you came onto the site and you&#8217;re not logged in, it will ask you to either log in or register for the site. So one of the things with a GatherPress site, if it&#8217;s something that you&#8217;re trying to attract the public to, you&#8217;ll have to, you know, check the box that says anybody can register for the site. And there is a notification when you install the plugin to say, hey, you might want to do this, you know, turn this on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once that&#8217;s turned on, if you, Nathan, were to come to the GatherPress site, you would then register. You know, like I said, we try not to be too opinionated. WordPress allows registration, WordPress allows login, so we&#8217;re going to leverage the default behavior of how WordPress functions there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, we&#8217;re going to look to extend on that, if people want a more, a different kind of look and feel for that. But, at the bare bones, we want people to be able to register and log in, like any other WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;re logged in, it&#8217;ll take you back. You know, once you create an account, you can go back to that event. You click RSVP, then you can say, I&#8217;m attending this, and you click the attend button. And now you&#8217;re on the list of people that are attending, and you&#8217;ll, you know, if the organiser sends out an email to those attending, you&#8217;ll receive that email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And should I wish to unsubscribe, is there options there? You know, I&#8217;m thinking GDPR, and all those kind of things. If I wish to no longer receive the emails, all of that, that&#8217;s taken care of, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:22] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So that is not. I need to work on that piece. One of the things we were looking to do with integration with BuddyPress was, BuddyPress has those options to turn off notifications. So leveraging that aspect of BuddyPress, but GatherPress will have to do a bare minimum for that too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So you have to login to each event&#8217;s website. So let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s a WordPress meetup in the UK. There might be one in Bristol, there might be one in Brighton, and London, and Manchester, and all these other different places. I would need to go and make an account on each of those websites, should they choose to use GatherPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess one of the benefits of meetup.com was that you just had this one sign up, which was kind of nice. I&#8217;m wondering around there, do you have any intuitions or thoughts on federating that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:04] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So that&#8217;s exactly what our proposal was. So our proposal is, if you think of it how WordCamps function, right? That they&#8217;re on a multi-site. So multi-sites use the same user database, right? What we would ideally want folks to use in this is, what they would log into wordpress.org with, so their profile, the wordpress.org profile, and utilise that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we have a multi-site powered, you know, with the event management powered by GatherPress, if you went to any of those meetups and they&#8217;re on that multi-site, it would be the same login for all of them. So then you&#8217;d be able to log into all of those different sites, and be able to say, I&#8217;m attending this, and it&#8217;s all the same user, it&#8217;s your WordPress profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is that then something you are hoping to put together in terms of infrastructure and maintenance thereof? A multi-site network where you can sign up as an admin, and bag brighton.gatherpress.com, or whatever it might be. And therefore you can federate that account login, and presumably therefore you could distribute, you could create another dashboard widget, which had all of the events that were in that multi-site network, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:08] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Right. So the idea is like, we&#8217;ve been talking and working with the meta team already. So like I&#8217;ve had conversations with say like Ian Dunn. He seemed pretty into the idea of setting up another network, kind of how we have with WordCamps, but with meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And setting up that network that would leverage the same sort of infrastructure that we are already kind of used to with wordpress.org and wordcamp.org, and be able to host those meetups in a multi-site, that have opted in to start using this new platform. Then being able to use their WordPress profile to log in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, there was also kind of some, you know, chat and thought about like, maybe someone should explore a single sign on with Meetup credentials, for people that still find it through Meetup. So if they already have Meetup credentials, maybe they can leverage that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But trying to remove a lot of the friction, where we can, is a big thing like, you and I both know like, you don&#8217;t want a million logins, and I don&#8217;t want a million logins to all different meetups. We want to keep that as simple as possible, and as straightforward as possible. Because the success of a project like this relies on people being able to easily create a, like, you know, have an account, or create one account, and be able to go to all those different WordPress meetups in that multi-site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think so. I think there&#8217;s something more likely to get off the ground, if there&#8217;s just one login. And then you can actually see, I don&#8217;t know, you could go as far as putting a map of the world up and, put pins in it based upon the events that are happening in the next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:33] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> The events page already, the events.wordpress, I think it&#8217;s events.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m blanking right now, but that has like all the different events that are happening. That was put together, I guess a couple months ago. But it was one of the reasons I started pushing forward on this, being like, hey, we are starting to use WordPress infrastructure for our events more seriously. This is a project I&#8217;ve been leading for the last couple years to help with that initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m looking at the documentation page, and helpfully there&#8217;s, obviously the documentation on the page itself, but you&#8217;ve got some links for users, you know, poeple who just wish to try out the plugin. But also developers, presumably if they wish to extend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a GitHub repository. All of this will be linked to in the show notes for this podcast. So if you go to wptavern.com, and look for the podcast episode associated with this, you&#8217;ll be able to find all of that there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also at the bottom, you&#8217;ve got a list of upcoming features. Now, I know that you&#8217;ve touched on a few of these, but if you just want list out what&#8217;s not been mentioned so far, if you can remember. And yeah, what&#8217;s in the roadmap for the near future, I guess?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:36] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> One of the big things that people, you know, I&#8217;ve thought of and people have confirmed, especially moving something like this is like, well, what about all the events I have on meetup.com? Like, how can I migrate those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the thoughts, like I mentioned, I&#8217;m very thoughtful about what goes into the core plugin for GatherPress. And anything that is kind of like, well, that&#8217;s specific to this, right? Say, if you&#8217;re migrating from meetup.com to GatherPress, you&#8217;d want some functionality to be able to do that easily and seamlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not everybody using GatherPress, so I don&#8217;t see that as a core feature of the plugin, but I do see that as a companion plugin. So that&#8217;s going to be our first, what we call companion plugin, called GatherPress Meetup Importer. And what that will do is take an API key from meetup.com, and be able to import the meetups that you&#8217;ve had already, on Meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since, like I mentioned, a lot of the features from meetup.com to GatherPress were close to apples to apples, we&#8217;d be able to take that data, and put it in the right spot for GatherPress. And then maybe running an ongoing job, so if you were, say, I want to be able to still use meetup.com to first publish, and have GatherPress ingest it as I go through, like kind of a trial and transition. We want to be able to have folks be able to do that too. And maybe like direct traffic to their GatherPress site, while still maintaining, for at least the time being, their presence on meetup.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s one of our first plugins that, you know, we&#8217;ve started on. I&#8217;ve been testing it, works great. There&#8217;s another plugin that does this already, and we&#8217;re kind of using that as a model, for building one that&#8217;s very specific and very, all the features are specific to GatherPress is kind of what we&#8217;re after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s great. I&#8217;ll just list off a couple of other things that are mentioned here. So I&#8217;ve got the ability for attendees to be listed anonymously, you mentioned that. Allow attendees to add guests. That&#8217;s nice. Import events, that&#8217;s the one you&#8217;ve just mentioned. Recurring events, so rather than duplicating the posts, there&#8217;ll be something built in, different functionality. A calendar block, presumably to show the events in a way that you might look at your Google calendar or something, you see it by date. And this is nice, probably underestimated how important it is, the email notification when the events start. I think that&#8217;s really crucial, especially if it&#8217;s a live event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:52] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Right now I just compose, and say starting five minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Easy to forget though. And you never know how many people you are sort of leaving behind, if that notification fails to go out. So that&#8217;s really nice. But also, the bit that I alluded to at the beginning, right at the beginning when I said that the date was the 23rd of January, comes now because, Patricia, that you mentioned, and I&#8217;ll link to this in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a pilot program, which you launched by pure coincidence, yesterday. So 22nd of Jan 2024. What is the community pilot program? What&#8217;s its intention? Who are you trying to get on board? Just tell us a little bit about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:25] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure, yeah. So that is the project that I mentioned about, building something into the wordpress.org infrastructure that powers meetups. So much like, you know, the meta team is behind the wordcamp.org, or wordpress.tv, or just wordpress.org. We want to have another multi-site in that network, for meetup events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re pushing for GatherPress to be the community plugin, that does the event management for that particular infrastructure. We have some meetups, and some more that have even responded to the proposal saying like, yeah, we&#8217;d love to be part of that pilot program too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a couple that are in the US, I think five that are in Switzerland, and some in Spain, that would love to be part of this pilot program, where we put this multi-site together. Each site on that multi-site is a meetup group. And then they start using that in tandem with meetup.com, in order to start driving more events around, within this WordPress powered event system. And starting to slowly move off meetup.com, and seeing how it goes. You know, see if something like that would be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you&#8217;re after community members. And just before we end the podcast, in a moment, I&#8217;ll ask for your contact details, and what have you. If you go to gatherpress.org, the way that I&#8217;m seeing about the community program, is because it is the most recent blog post, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m looking at what looks like an archive of blog posts. But I noticed that the archive of blog posts is probably in some way using GatherPress itself, because I&#8217;ve got these RSVP buttons, and if I click into the GatherPress weekly huddle, I notice that I&#8217;ve got add to calendar links, and I&#8217;ve got an RSVP button, which invokes a modal. Is that GatherPress in action?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:08] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> That is GatherPress in action. Anybody can join. 11:00 am Eastern Standard Time. We have our GatherPress weekly huddle, and that&#8217;s when the team gets together. Any folks that are interested in GatherPress, there&#8217;s a Zoom link. It&#8217;s an online event. And we have that every week on Fridays. So Friday, 11:00 am, Eastern Time, we have those every week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And if you go to gatherpress.org, you&#8217;ll be able to see them, well, as the page currently stands you can see them, and obviously the most recent one in this case rises to the top. So you can just scroll down a little way, and click the button to RSVP, and get yourself set up in that community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:45] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> You can click through and see more event details. But, yeah, that is another block that we have for pages, called Event List. That will show various events, whether past or upcoming. So that&#8217;s another feature of GatherPress as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve thought of everything. Brilliant. Okay, just before we knock it on the head then, Mike, I think probably some people listening to this will be in tune with what you&#8217;re saying, and hopefully will wish to reach out to you, to find out more about the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, they could go to the website, that&#8217;s a given. If they want to contact you personally, or in more personal way, do you have a social network handle that you hang out on, or an email address that you&#8217;re willing to give out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:19] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Twitter&#8217;s a good one. It&#8217;s M Auteri, M-A-U-T-E-R-I. So my first initial and my last name, you can find us there. If you send me a DM, and we have a GatherPress Slack. We also have a GatherPress Twitter, which we&#8217;re starting to use a little bit more, now that we&#8217;ve gone a little bit more public with it. And that is just GatherPress. So if you find GatherPress on Twitter, spelled exactly as it is on the website. You can follow us there. You know, we just started using that Twitter account, so I don&#8217;t even know if it has any followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. There&#8217;s also, in the main navigation of the gatherpress.org website, there&#8217;s an item entitled Get Involved. And if you click over there, you&#8217;ll be able to see a contact form, plus the GatherPress Slack group link is there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:59] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah, I think Mervin added that like yesterday, so that all brand new stuff, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is all shiny and new, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s lovely. The feeling that you get from these brand new products is so engaging, and I really hope that you managed to keep the momentum going. It sounds like you&#8217;ve got a lot of interest in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:16] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah We&#8217;ve been keeping that momentum going. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Thank so much for chatting to us about GatherPress today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:22] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Thank you for having me. I appreciate it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mauteri\">Mike Auteri</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike is an Associate Director of Engineering at Penske Media Corporation, as well as the founder and engineering lead of the <a href=\"https://gatherpress.org/\">GatherPress project</a>. He’s contributed code to WordPress Core and Gutenberg, is a WordPress community team supporter, has written plugins, presented at meetups and WordCamps, and is a co-organiser of the WordPress Montclair Meetup in New Jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve attended a WordPress meetup event, it’s quite likely that you registered for that via the meetup.com platform. It’s become the defacto way for organisers of events to plan their meetups, send out invites, subscribe users, and promote future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, Mike decided that it was time for WordPress events to have a WordPress based solution for event management, and so he set to work creating GatherPress, which is the focus of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike talks about the way events are currently managed and why he thinks it’s time to transition to something more home-grown. He thinks that GatherPress represents a significant leap forward in enhancing the event planning and participation experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the development journey of GatherPress, discussing its current features and the advantages he feels it offers to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also examine GatherPress&#8217;s capacity to enable event coordination and foster meaningful community engagement. He’s envisioning a future where event management built on top of WordPress is a hallmark of the WordPress event experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the roadmap features that are just around the corner, as well as chatting about the community which has grown up around the plugin, and how that community is looking for people to help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a WordPress event organiser, or have attended a meetup in the past and are curious about how this could be handled by a freely available plugin, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pmc.com/\">Penske Media Corporation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\">meetup.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gatherpress.org/\">GatherPress plugin website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/\">GatherPress GitHub repository</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/01/22/proposal-pilot-program-to-test-gatherpress-on-the-wordpress-org-network-as-a-meetup-alternative/\">Proposal: Pilot program to test GatherPress on the WordPress.org network as a Meetup alternative</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mauteri\">Mike&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gatherpress.slack.com/\">GatherPress Slack group</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatherpress\">GatherPress Twitter</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.4.3 – Maintenance and Security release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=16754\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/01/wordpress-6-4-3-maintenance-and-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7054:\"<p>This security and maintenance release features <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&component=!Bundled+Theme&id=!59828&milestone=6.4.3&group=status&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=version&col=keywords&order=priority\">5 bug fixes on Core</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/5698#issuecomment-1909302298\">16 bug fixes for the Block Editor</a>, and 2 security fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Because this is a security release, it is recommended that you update your sites immediately.</strong> Backports are also available for other major WordPress releases, 4.1 and later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.4.3.zip\">download WordPress 6.4.3 from WordPress.org</a>, or visit your WordPress Dashboard, click “Updates”, and then click “Update Now”.

Just kidding. But we did introduce a concept into Automattic that I think will provide a lot of clarity for the teams within Automattic, and hopefully for the broader WordPress ecosystem that works and partners with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame is there&#8217;s a game, each person gets a card: Be the Host, Help the Host, or Neutral.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You cannot change cards during the course of your day or week. If you do not feel aligned with your card, you need to change divisions within Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re Be the Host, you are hyper-competitive. You are trying to make the case to a customer for why they should host with you and not consider anyone else. This is what everyone assumes all of Automattic is, but it&#8217;s actually just one sub-division, which is a minority of our revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Help the Hosts, your word is <strong>ecosystem</strong>. You plant the seeds of open source software that grow everywhere. Every WordPress is precious to you, wherever it grew up. You want every host to be as successful as possible, because the real threat is from the Big Proprietary folks outside, who steal all your good ideas and don’t let you touch them again. You want to get to know every WordPress in the world, however it grew up, and help it out by selling it attachments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neutral treats everyone equally, either because they don&#8217;t care (Day One, Pocket Casts, et cetera don&#8217;t have a horse in this race) or because they are a support function like finance or HR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you meet or talk to an Automattician you can ask what their card is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, WordPress.com is going to orient itself more towards developers, and have an experience that feels similar to WordPress hosted other places, less Calypso more wp-admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big tension this surfaced was Woo Express, going forward that team is switching under WP.com, and Woo.com will recommend a variety of hosts (like W.org) to get started with Woo. Now people can meet with Paul Maiorana, who leads Woo, or James Grierson, who leads Jetpack, and know they have Help the Hosts cards as their teleological goal.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 28 Jan 2024 20:08:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: Freedom Grants\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=110880\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://ma.tt/2024/01/freedom-grants/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:729:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://audrey.co/scholars/\">Audrey Scholars program</a> is still getting started, but I wanted to introduce another opportunity: <a href=\"https://audrey.co/freedom-grants/\">Freedom grants</a>.

Here we go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Dave, I&#8217;m so excited to have you here with us today. Welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:42] <strong>Dave:</strong> Thank you. I&#8217;m really excited to be here. Thank you so much for inviting me on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So before we get much further, how about you tell us a little bit about what you do on the WordPress project? And if I recall correctly, that you have a role on the release squad. So just let us know a bit about what that role is and what that looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Sure. Absolutely. Well, obviously said I&#8217;m Dave Smith. I&#8217;m from England in the United Kingdom, and I am full-time contributor to WordPress. I&#8217;ve focused primarily on the Block Editor during that time. And I&#8217;ve been doing it for about three years now. And fortunately for me, I am sponsored by Automattic, so that allows me to contribute full-time to the project, which is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my history of WordPress goes back a fair way longer than that, and I used to work in agency land, and so I used WordPress for making things for a living before I worked in WordPress if you see what I mean.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I, no, I definitely understand. I also was agency before WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:40] <strong>Dave:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a common origin story, if you see what I mean. And yes, you&#8217;re absolutely right. I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough in this release, WordPress 6.5, to be the Co-editor Tech Lead. Obviously alongside my colleague which is Riad Benguella. Some of you may know him. He is the lead architect of Gutenberg. So yeah, it&#8217;s been fantastic to work alongside him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, excellent. One of these days, I&#8217;m going to get Riad on here. I think I&#8217;ve never had him on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:05] <strong>Dave:</strong> Oh, you should definitely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> He&#8217;s so kind and reasonable. And I was just gonna tell a personal anecdote about Riad, and I don&#8217;t know that it makes any sense, but I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway. I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway. I saw him at an event like right after he came back from his most recent sabbatical, and he was like, it was great being away, but also like, I had forgotten what kind of energy events like this really bring in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he has always struck me as an introvert, but I think maybe he&#8217;s like an outgoing introvert or something. Cause normally, like, introvert introverts are not like, this gives me so much energy. They&#8217;re like, I know that this is important work, and I&#8217;m here. And so that&#8217;s my personal anecdote about Riad, I am, gonna get him on here someday, but be that as it may, we&#8217;re delighted to have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, 6.5 is coming out are you excited, number one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:54] <strong>Dave:</strong> I am very excited. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a long road into this release. As you may know, well, as you do know, it&#8217;s, it was delayed by one week. That was actually, I think was, was a good decision. We&#8217;ve had a lot of work needing to go into the Font Library feature. I&#8217;ve seen a few posts saying there were bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:09] <strong>Dave:</strong> I think mainly it was a decision about where to upload fonts to, which seems quite amazing when you think about it. I was talking to my wife about it the other day, and she said, really, you&#8217;re delaying a release because of where to upload things. But, yeah, this is software that runs a considerable part of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when we make these decisions about where things uploaded, we&#8217;ve got to be really confident that they are the right decisions. And so, yeah, that decision to delay the release has been good. And we&#8217;ve had an opportunity to make sure the release is fully robust and ready to go out. So yeah, I&#8217;m super excited to see it land.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I have some follow up questions about just like, how doing all of that work in public feels. But probably, we should get through the bulk of the sorts of things that people tune into this episode for, so like, let&#8217;s talk about some of the big features that are going into 6.5 so that folks have a sense for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we&#8217;ll take a look at just like things that you&#8217;re excited to get in, things that I&#8217;m excited to get in. And maybe like if there&#8217;s a hidden surprise for users, things that will be really beneficial to users, but they don&#8217;t quite see it yet. We can maybe cover that too, but like, what are the big things going into this release from your perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:17] <strong>Dave:</strong> Sure. There&#8217;s some highlights, I think that the key highlights, and we should probably cover them. So the first one we&#8217;ve already touched on it is the Fonts Library. And this has been brewing for a while now, and it&#8217;s finally come to fruition. And it basically allows you to manage, install, and upload custom fonts for use on your website. And it&#8217;s really, really powerful. It&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s going to really change the way people create themes and create their websites. It is unlocking a lot of power for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And for folks who&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a long time, you have heard me say for, I think, like a year, basically every release podcast where we&#8217;re looking at what&#8217;s coming up. I&#8217;m like, and this time it&#8217;s fonts. I&#8217;m so excited. And so I&#8217;m saying it again this time, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s really happening this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Dave:</strong> It&#8217;s finally here. Yeah, it&#8217;s a great feature. There&#8217;s a lot of work gone into it. It&#8217;s really, really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So much work. We&#8217;ve been working on it for like two or three years. And it&#8217;s at the point where like getting it out in front of people is the only way to figure out where the remaining problems will be. And it is the most scary part of any software release, I assume, the things where you&#8217;re like, this is time for people to tell us how it&#8217;s broken. Please look at it and break it for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:29] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. We&#8217;ve been working on resolving any bugs that we could find, but there&#8217;s always going to be things we haven&#8217;t noticed. So yeah, we can&#8217;t wait for users to get their hands on it. Exactly. Other than fonts, we&#8217;ve also got revisions that are now in place in the Site Editor. And this is more than just undo, redo that people may be already familiar with in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It actually gives you the ability to fully revert your site back to any state that you previously had it. So you could make some changes in the editor. You could completely close down your computer, go away for a week, come back. And you&#8217;ve still got the opportunity to say, &#8220;Ah, do you know what? I don&#8217;t like the way that looks. I&#8217;m just gonna; I&#8217;m gonna roll that back.&#8221; And there&#8217;s a nice UI that shows you what it will affect. And you can even roll back styles, you know, like style changes. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s super, super powerful. And it&#8217;s just something we&#8217;ve been waiting for for such a long time. Just, it&#8217;s fantastic to see it land.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m really excited about this one personally because I have been to so many meetup events with like new users being taught how to do things with WordPress. And invariably, in the last two or three years, the people who are presenting to new users are saying consistently like, &#8220;You can do any experimental thing that you feel like you need to do with your sites because there&#8217;s an undo button. WordPress wouldn&#8217;t let you do things that fully break your site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like there is a lot of trust in our kind of like time machine, roll-it-back kind of implementations. And so I&#8217;m really excited about this one. I think that for all of our new and mid-level users. Who like, have a little bit of fear, but mostly joy around it. Like, this will only increase that and so I&#8217;m super excited for this one to go in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:09] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s really nice. Other than that, the two things I wanted to touch on as well, which is we&#8217;ve got these new views now for key objects in WordPress. So things like pages, patterns, templates, and template parts in the Site Editor. You can now view these in a sort of a table layout or in a grid layout. So it gives you a much easier way to sort them, find them, filter them. And I think it points us forward to the possibilities we&#8217;ve got in the future for the editor sort of taking some parts of WP Admin and making them more accessible without having to leave the Site Editor. And it&#8217;s extremely powerful; you can search in real-time, find things very, very quickly, do all the things you&#8217;re used to from the post listing screen, but all within the Site Editor. And it&#8217;s for these key objects that you use quite a lot of the time. So I think it&#8217;s going to be really, a really great thing for users to get hold of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Is this related to the Data Views work that we&#8217;ve been doing in the first part of the year here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Exactly that exactly. The Data Views work has been a major feed into this, and this is where we see the fruits of all that work coming to the fore for the first time. And I expect to see more of that in future releases as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. For folks who are really, really watching, like, our administrative side of things, you probably are aware that we, I don&#8217;t know, I wouldn&#8217;t say that we paused the phase three roadmap for this, but I do think that we made a clear choice to get this Data Views work done first so that we could, in parallel with phase three, do a bit of work on the WP Admin redesign, the dashboard redesign, which we all know, like, we love this dashboard, but also this dashboard, it needs a sprucing up, it needs a little bit of, of polish and a little bit of 2024 style I was going to say design. I don&#8217;t know if the design folks would love if I just was like, it needs to be modernized that way, but also like it, it does, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, and I mean, you know, we all know that the Site Editor is being used more and more. If you&#8217;ve got a Block theme, you&#8217;re using the Site Editor increasingly, and you&#8217;re spending less and less time sort of going between screens in WP Admin. So it makes sense that, you know, these things are accessible within that one interface of the Site Editor. So, yeah, it&#8217;s only going to be a good thing for users going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I probably should have like a whole episode about Data Views and what it&#8217;s intending to do, what it&#8217;s actually doing, what it&#8217;s going to look like as it goes because that&#8217;s such a big project. And so many things rely on it. And so, note to self and all listeners, that&#8217;s the thing that you should keep an eye out for. We&#8217;re going to get it done. But you said you had a final thing also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;ve got one more which is this is for our users of classic themes. We haven&#8217;t forgotten about you. Basically, we now have support for appearance tools. So in prior releases, the Block themes have got these really cool design tools like ability to set border colors, border radius, link colors, you name it. We&#8217;ve got all these tools, but they haven&#8217;t been always available to classic themes. And classic themes can use the Block Editor; they may not be using the Site Editor in the same way, but they can use the Block Editor. And we&#8217;ve not made those things available in the same way, but there&#8217;s been work going into this release to allow that to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:11] <strong>Dave:</strong> So now you can opt into those if you so wish. And it is an opt-in basis. So none your themes will break out of the box if you&#8217;ve got classic theme or classic site. But it is a powerful tool to those people who are using classic themes, and that&#8217;s completely legitimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so is the opt in like something that you can do for yourself or something that your developer needs to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:32] <strong>Dave:</strong> You would need to do it in your theme code. So you&#8217;d need to do that with PHP. So, your theme developer, if they choose to update their theme and provide support for these things. Then, they would obviously need to test their theme works with those new tools, make sure it&#8217;s ready, and then they would ship that update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so maybe after 6.5 is released, you may see some themes incrementally adding support. My understanding at the moment is that the core themes, the Block themes, will not automatically add those straight away. I think they need more time to allow them to bed in and more time to get them ready for prime time if you see what I mean, but you know the fact that they&#8217;re there and ready means that the wider theme audience and theme developers can start taking advantage of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Nice, nice. I have been wondering lately, this is only marginally related, but I&#8217;m gonna wonder it out loud anyway. I&#8217;ve been wondering lately if like, our classic themes, our most favorite, our most loved classic themes do need a little bit of help moving into a Block theme future. And I think that this will help. I think, on the one hand this will help, and on the other hand, like, what would it take for us to just say, and you&#8217;re not the theme person I know, but like, what would it take for us to just say, &#8220;These are our top five most favorite, most used, classic themes that we&#8217;ve got in WordPress. Let&#8217;s rebuild it in blocks and just ship the block version of it and help the classic themes users that love the design, love the look, love the features get introduced to this new block territory so that they can see that not only do they have the look, the feel, the features, but also the flexibility that comes with that and a little bit more feeling of safety as they wander around modifying themes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have no fear of any code changes and didn&#8217;t when I started working with WordPress, as opposed to working in WordPress, but I think that that&#8217;s not the way that that works right now. Like there&#8217;s a whole lot of like, I need to get it right-ish with folks who are using our software. And so I just wonder if that will help everybody feel a little more confident in what they&#8217;re doing, knowing they&#8217;re not going to break things because we&#8217;ve built it so you can&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:45] <strong>Dave:</strong> It could do, it could do. And I was just thinking as you were talking, like, do we have any themes that already do that? And, of course, we do have 2021. If you can think back that far into the mists of time, we had 2021 classic, which is that it&#8217;s called 2021, but we also 2021 blocks, which is doing very much what you&#8217;ve just described.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] <strong>Dave:</strong> So we haven&#8217;t pursued that for the new default themes or block themes, but, you know, it might be something to look at for onboarding if there are any of classic themes from the more distant past, you know, maybe some of those could do with a block theme equivalent just to let people on board to that experience and just feel comfortable. Yeah, interesting, interesting. You should definitely talk to the theme people about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m going to. They&#8217;re going to love it. They&#8217;re going to be like, Yay! Of course! Of course! I don&#8217;t know, actually. I don&#8217;t know if anyone ever loves the things that I suggest, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re not going to get suggested. I have all these ideas, and they got to come out somewhere. Okay. So do you have something that you worked on that&#8217;s not in this big list of features or that you helped people to really shepherd into the release that you think is really cool? Like, maybe it&#8217;s not going to be super visible or something, but like that you&#8217;ve personally felt was like a cool feature, excited for it to get into the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:53] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, there are a couple of things, a couple of things at the top of mind. One of them is user-facing and one of them is more developer-facing features. So, I&#8217;ll start with the developer feature first. And this one is a change to an API. Now, that API is always a slightly intimidating word, I think, but it just means a set of tools, a standardized set of tools that developers can use to do something. And in this case, it&#8217;s the allowed blocks API.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sounds so fun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:21] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I know it&#8217;s riveting, isn&#8217;t it? But trust me, it does come with some benefits. So the Navigation block is a good example. It&#8217;s a block that acts as a container and it&#8217;s got child blocks. Okay. But you can only insert certain blocks. You can insert links, you can insert social icons, you can insert search. But if you want to insert, I don&#8217;t know, an Icon block, for example. You can&#8217;t do that, but you can with WordPress 6.5 because of the change to the allow box API. And what it allows you to do is say, &#8220;I want to additionally allow the following blocks to be inserted as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as a developer, you can hook into this filter and change those blocks. Now, okay, so far, so good. &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal?&#8221; you might say, well, it&#8217;s open the door, is open the door to some very, very interesting explorations. Some of which I&#8217;ve no doubt that you and your listeners would have already encountered. And one is by a colleague of mine called Nick Diego. And I think it&#8217;s on the WordPress Developer blog right now. I think he&#8217;s done a fantastic inspiration into mega menus in the navigation block. I&#8217;m someone who&#8217;s worked on the Navigation block extensively in the past, and I&#8217;m very aware of how much users want mega menus to be a part of the Navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] <strong>Dave:</strong> I was never convinced it was going to be something we were going to do in core, because it requires so many different things. But Nick has actually managed with this allow blocks API and some other tweaks as well to build a mega menu as a plugin for WordPress using the standard Navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s just one example of the utility of this API. But for example, I mentioned that you could add icons to your Navigation block and you can&#8217;t really do that at the moment. It&#8217;s pretty powerful. It&#8217;s kind of hidden away. It&#8217;s in the release notes, but it&#8217;s not massively clear, but it does open some pretty big doors. And I think if you&#8217;re a developer or a theme author, indeed, you should you should definitely be looking into that and see what it enables for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ll put a link to Nick&#8217;s post in the show notes, and we&#8217;ll share it around the social spaces. So like, I hear you saying it&#8217;s buried, it&#8217;s hard to see, it won&#8217;t necessarily be exciting now, but will be exciting later, but like mega menus and sliders, those are the most contested things that people want to put on sites all the time. Like from my agency days, like when I was thinking in the mindset of a strategist, a data person, that&#8217;s what I was doing. Like, I never wanted sliders. I never wanted mega menus because it just implied that we didn&#8217;t have a decision about the sites we were making, like we had not decided the primary purpose, and also it was just hard to track, but it was always literally every single time people are like well if Amazon has it why can&#8217;t we have it? You&#8217;re like, yeah, I know, but they&#8217;re Amazon. They&#8217;re not the same like mega menus sliders. I know that from a project perspective that we&#8217;re like, that should be a theme thing. That should be in theme territory. But I think it makes sense to have in core because so many people want to be able to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And just because like someone like me feels like it&#8217;s not the right call for your business doesn&#8217;t mean that you shouldn&#8217;t be able to make that decision for yourself, you know, I think that&#8217;s a, I think that&#8217;s a great, a great feature to call out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:28] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I completely agree. I can look for my agency days. I can exactly imagine that sort of thing. We have a lot of people, a problem that a lot of people are facing. So it&#8217;s really important that we provide the tools to allow people to do that now. And we can always look at if it&#8217;s valid to include it in core later, then we can look at that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the first one I had. The second one is a little bit more user-facing. I would say it&#8217;s hidden away. But I&#8217;m not 100 percent sure it is. I mean, Josepha, how often do you create links when you&#8217;re working with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like every time that I&#8217;m in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Same here. I do it all the time, right? And a lot of people do. And for a long while, contributors to the editor have been sort of collecting and collating the feedback that&#8217;s come in from people about their frustrations with the built in link interface in the Block Editor. So if you&#8217;re creating a hyperlink to, you know, hyperlink to another page or, you know, you&#8217;re going to link to Nick&#8217;s mega menu article, you&#8217;re going to be doing that a lot, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that people do when they&#8217;re creating content in WordPress. And so we worked a lot to refine that with a contributor who, who you may know, Rich Tabor. Who&#8217;s also, I think, on the release squad as well. An influencer in the WordPress space as well. He spent a lot of time looking at the UX and myself and a number of other contributors have spent a lot of time in this release refining that. And I think it&#8217;s surprisingly difficult to get right, but I think we&#8217;ve, I think we&#8217;ve made some nice improvements to that will be nice quality of life for people who, to do this sort of content creation quite a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s things like now when you create the link for the first time, it remains open on the initial creation of the link. So that means you can quickly then easily adjust the link. I mean, it seems obvious, doesn&#8217;t it? Yeah, but it&#8217;s not happening. It just used to just automatically close, and the people are like, &#8220;Hey, I wanted to make more adjustments.&nbsp;&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I wasn&#8217;t done yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:10] <strong>Dave:</strong> Exactly. Yeah, exactly. We&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve streamlined the UI. We&#8217;ve removed a lot of clutter, but we&#8217;ve also added some useful tools, like ability to copy a link and remove the link directly from the control itself. And lastly along with lots of other accessibility changes in this release. We have worked a lot on refining the implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is discoverable for, for users of assistive tech because we spent a lot of time talking to core accessibility team and other people, and they were finding it very hard to perceive that the UI was there because of the way that keyboard interactions work and you&#8217;ve got the block toolbar in the way and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We think we&#8217;ve nailed on a really good solution now that works for, not only uses assistive tech, but actually provides benefits for sighted users as well. It&#8217;s kind of difficult to talk about. I mean, I have got a video covering this on my YouTube channel, which kind of shows it in a bit more detail, but we&#8217;re happy it&#8217;s in a much better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:02] <strong>Dave:</strong> And yeah if people have got feedback about it, and when, when 6.5 comes out, we&#8217;re always happy to hear that. And you can go to the WordPress GitHub repository and raise an issue. And one of us will jump on it and see what we can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And we can include a link to that video also. So like, for folks where this sounded intriguing, but they don&#8217;t quite get the concept, like video content all day, let&#8217;s pop it into our show notes. And everybody can take a look at it there. I think that&#8217;s a great idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:28] <strong>Dave:</strong> Great. Yeah, I appreciate that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So final question, maybe, maybe final question, final planned question. Is there anything from a user-facing perspective again that you feel has not really gotten the airtime that it needs so far?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:44] <strong>Dave:</strong> I think there&#8217;s a lot of technical changes that have happened in this release. So it&#8217;s easy to look at those. I mean, we&#8217;ve covered quite a lot of the key ones that will be user-facing in terms of Font Library and Revisions. We&#8217;ve got things that are going to this release that enable things a lot for people to experience in the future, I think, so underlying changes like the Interactivity API becoming public. Now that&#8217;s public, plugin developers can start to make sites much more interactive on the front of the site rather than just in the editor. So I think that once 6.5 has gone in, and people have started to explore the Interactivity API in more detail, we might see more plugins offering sort of interactivity on the fronts of their sites. An example is obviously the lightbox you&#8217;ve got with images in core, but I can; there&#8217;s way more stuff that you can do with that. So we&#8217;re going to see more of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:28] <strong>Dave:</strong> We&#8217;ve got Block Hooks that have landed in 6.5, and this is going to open for things like ecommerce plugins and to be able to add, you know, cart blocks or log in, log out blocks to things like navigation, for example, or you might want a ability to like all your comments, and you can do that with Block Hooks and then a plugin developer can just, you know, when the plugin is enabled, they can just make it so that those things just appear on your site, but you still got control over the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot of like hidden things I think are going to uncover new features for users over time as a result of the community getting involved and changing their plugins and themes to do these take advantage of these new tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, so the Interactivity API, obviously it has &#8220;API&#8221; on it. And so no one&#8217;s thinking, well, this is a user-facing thing. And while the API is not a user facing thing, like, I think that you&#8217;re right. That what it enables absolutely is going to be really useful and hopefully really engaging for like end-to-end users, like the users that are not listening to this podcast and they don&#8217;t know we exist, like they don&#8217;t know that WordPress has a community building it, they&#8217;re just like, it exists, there&#8217;s a software that came out of nowhere, like, I&#8217;m really excited to see how our developers in the community start to use that in their plugins and themes and get that out to end users. I&#8217;m really, really excited to see how creative they get with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you have a final thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:51] <strong>Dave:</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of design changes, I think. I mean, we can&#8217;t cover them all, obviously, in verbal form in this podcast, but some things that are just standing out to me if we look at the source of truth for, for WordPress 6.5, it is, it is big. There&#8217;s a lot in this release. But there&#8217;s some very cool things for, I don&#8217;t know, quality. I like to see them as like quality of life design design changes. Things like, if you drop an image, as a background image of a cover block, it automatically sets the overlay color for that cover block to match the most prominent color of the background image. Like things like that, they seem small, but over time, they just, you just drop that thing, and it just does it. And it&#8217;s like, this is nice. And it feels like a nice tool to use that just is intuitive. And I think there&#8217;s, we&#8217;ll see a lot of those things landing in this release that can just make the experience of working with WordPress and working in the Site Editor much, much nicer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I remember when I first ran into that particular thing, it was on the Showcase, our most recent redesign of it. We&#8217;re using that functionality in there before it was available in core. Obviously, I know, but it was really fascinating. I&#8217;m not great with color combinations. Like, I don&#8217;t have a sense for, like, oh, that&#8217;s the primary thing. That&#8217;s not. And so having that being done kind of automatically so that my stuff looks good anyway, despite what my color sense said to do or not. I thought it was great. Makes you look good as somebody who&#8217;s running a business. You don&#8217;t have to know how things work in order to have excellently functional, really beautiful things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I think that&#8217;s a great thing about all of our releases. Obviously, everything is supposed to work that way, but like this one has a lot of really cool things like that available. I think those are really the questions that I had. Is there anything you want to make sure to share before we kind of give last thoughts and head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:39] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I was, I was thinking a lot about, you know, the community we&#8217;ve got with WordPress, and I think that people outside of WordPress may not really understand that how amazing this community is that we&#8217;ve got here, but I wanted to say to people like don&#8217;t shy away from contributing to WordPress. I get that, you know, people like myself are fortunate enough to be sponsored to do it. But there&#8217;s always something that people can do, even if that&#8217;s just spending like 30 minutes testing a release or donating some of your time to run one of the meetings. It can really make a difference overall. Even just filing a bug report for something you see in WordPress 6.5 or testing 6.5 before it goes out, those little things do make a big difference. And if you&#8217;re not sure where to go, then we can signpost you with links, no doubt in this, in the podcast description with where where&#8217;s to go. But yeah, I just want to encourage people to get involved, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. And it&#8217;s all working out in public, like we&#8217;ve got developers, designers, marketing folks, community folks like all doing this work out where everybody can see it. And so that, I know, can look really kind of overwhelming. But I want to just highlight, like, you don&#8217;t have to know everything about what&#8217;s happening in the project in order to get involved in the project. Like every small bit of contribution toward like finding a new bug or confirming that a bug happens across other devices, other setups, things like that, like those all help make things better and keep things moving as quickly as we are able to make them move. And so, yeah, I&#8217;ll second that every little thing that you think like that won&#8217;t make a difference. It does. We can&#8217;t tell that things are broken or things are working or things are in need of some care unless you highlight those for us. And this is the best way to do it is to show up and give 30 minutes to send out a group testing invite to your meetup group or whatever it is that you all have been thinking you should do, like, this is your sign. You can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:34] <strong>Dave:</strong> Everyone should get involved if they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:37] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I agree. I agree. Dave, this has been such an excellent conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:42] <strong>Dave:</strong> Oh, thank you very much. It&#8217;s a pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:43] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> What an interesting release we&#8217;ve got coming out this week. I&#8217;m so glad you all made it this far in the pod, and now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First up, following up on the WordPress meetup reactivation project that we had in 2022, we aim to revive some meetup groups in big cities that are inactive or help the local WordPress community that are not yet part of our meetup chapter program to join our program. There is a post out on the community P2 on the community site. That is titled Asia Meetup Revival Project 2024. I&#8217;ll leave a link to that in the show notes if you want to read more about that and figure out how to get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of getting involved, we have roughly a million meetings. Because it&#8217;s a new month, we&#8217;re in April now. New month, new opportunities. There are a lot of things happening in April. We will be coming out of a major release, obviously, and so there will be some minor release follow up to do. There will be a lot of discussion about what&#8217;s coming next, what&#8217;s in trunk, what&#8217;s not in trunk. But also a lot of work being done around our next big major events, our next big major training initiatives. There&#8217;s just so much happening. Spring is a time when we are looking at stuff that&#8217;s new, what we want to invest in, what we want to grow. And so if you have not attended one in a while or even at all if you&#8217;ve never attended a meeting in the community, then this is a great time to start and join your fellow community members trying to make WordPress better every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing on our small list of big things is I am looking at helping to shift the focus of our WordPress marketing community. We&#8217;ve had a bit of a struggle over the years to figure out what our primary focus and our primary impact can be. So there&#8217;s a post up called &#8216;Making a WordPress Media Corps&#8217;. It&#8217;s gotten quite a bit of attention, and I do really think that it has a lot of potential for solving some of the issues that we have and kind of getting some quick wins into our recent history of that team so that we can move forward confidently together. So pop on over, give it a read, share your thoughts. And if you are one of these qualified media partners, also let us know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

An award-winning artist and storied jazz educator known for transcending genre, Regina’s technical foundations in classical music and deep understanding of jazz have earned her the reputation of boldly going beyond what’s possible with the violin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let the stunning twists and subtle turns of <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO1WEiVo?si=534335c984804713\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO1WEiVo?si=534335c984804713\">Regina’s genre-bending sound</a> surprise you as you explore everything 6.5 offers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest version of WordPress puts more power into the details. It offers new and improved ways to fine-tune and enhance your site-building experience, letting you take control in ways that make it your own. You’ll find new ways to manage your site’s typography, more comprehensive revisions available in more places, and a collection of Site Editor updates paired with impressive performance gains to help you get things done smoother and faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Regina&#8221; also marks the introduction of some breakthrough developer tools that will start transforming how you use and extend blocks to craft engaging experiences. The Interactivity API opens up a world of creative front-end possibilities, while the Block Bindings API makes dynamic connections between blocks and data seamless. These, among other developer-focused improvements and updates, are ready to help you evolve how you build with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">Download WordPress 6.5 &#8220;Regina&#8221;</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s inside 6.5</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add and manage fonts across your site</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Font Library puts you in control of an essential piece of your site’s design—typography—without coding or extra steps.

It simplifies the process, with fewer dependencies on external tooling, while maintaining optimal performance. Use it to create memorable user experiences, like fetching search results instantly or letting visitors interact with content in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connect blocks to custom fields or other dynamic content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Link core block attributes to custom fields and use the value of custom fields without creating custom blocks. Powered by the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/06/new-feature-the-block-bindings-api/\">Block Bindings API</a>, developers can extend this capability further to connect blocks to any dynamic content—even beyond custom fields. If there’s data stored elsewhere, easily point blocks to that new source with only a few lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add appearance tools to Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Give designers and creators using Classic themes access to an upgraded design experience. Opt in to support for spacing, border, typography, and color options, even without using theme.json. Once support is enabled, more tools will be automatically added as they become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Explore improvements to the plugin experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s now an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/05/introducing-plugin-dependencies-in-wordpress-6-5/\">easier way to manage plugin dependencies</a>. Plugin authors can supply a new <code>Requires Plugins</code> header with a comma-separated list of required plugin slugs, presenting users with links to install and activate those plugins first.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From fast to faster: Performance updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes 110+ performance updates, resulting in an impressive increase in speed and efficiency across the Post Editor and Site Editor. Loading is over two times faster than in 6.4, with input processing speed up to five times faster than the previous release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Translated sites see up to 25% improvement in load time for this release courtesy of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/27/i18n-improvements-6-5-performant-translations/\">Performant Translations</a>. Additional performance highlights include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/23/wordpress-6-5-adds-avif-support/\">AVIF image support</a> and improvements for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/29/performance-improvements-for-registering-block-variations-with-callbacks/\">registering block variations with callbacks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A tradition of inclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes more than 65 accessibility improvements across the platform, making it more accessible than ever. It contains an important fix that unblocks access to the admin submenus for screen reader users and others who navigate by keyboard. This release also adds fixes to color contrast in admin focus states, positioning of elements, and cursor focus, among many others, that help improve the WordPress experience for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn more about WordPress 6.5</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/6-5/\">WordPress 6.5 page</a>&nbsp;to learn more about the numerous enhancements and features of this release—including short demos of some of the highlighted features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explore <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> for quick how-to videos, <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/social-learning/\">online workshops</a>, and other free resources to level up your WordPress knowledge and skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/15/wordpress-6-5-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.5 Field Guide</a> for detailed technical information and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes-6-5/\">developer notes</a> to help you build with WordPress and get the most out of this release.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> I have returned from WordCamp Asia and struggled my way through some truly aggressive jet lag, so that means it&#8217;s time for a little WordCamp wrap-up. I spoke with a couple hundred people at the event, and I came away with a few topics that seemed to be on everyone&#8217;s minds. Those topics are: making business in WordPress, the business of making WordPress, and how to communicate both sides a little better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So first, let&#8217;s start with making business in WordPress. This comes up at every event, and that honestly just makes sense. WordPress is a tool that people use to power their businesses across our global economy, and sometimes the businesses are closely related to WordPress itself. They are creating custom themes or plugins, building WordPress powered commerce sites for clients, or offering any number of agency services. But there are also businesses that are a little less close: restaurants, museums, local governments, schools. But it was clear that they all rely on the software just as much as the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it was nice to see some sessions that focused specifically on business matters in WordPress. And I heard so many people tell me about a conversation they had had earlier in the day with someone who helped them figure out their pricing or advised them on early errors they made in their business journey and generally helped them feel a little less lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always love seeing this. Hearing how people are accomplishing their goals because of connections they made at one of our events, it&#8217;s enough to keep me coming back for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that came up a lot was the business of making WordPress. I don&#8217;t know if that came up a lot because of the sorts of conversations that people are willing to bring to me these days or because there was overwhelming interest in knowing how we keep all these trains on their tracks. But either way, it was refreshing to be able to have so many conversations about the invisible work that goes into a project like this. There was a Contributor Day that hosted over 600 people, if I recall correctly, which makes it the largest Contributor Day in the area to date. 35 percent of those people had never attended a Contributor Day before, so there were a lot of people who were discovering the WordPress community for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for folks who&#8217;ve been here for a long time, it&#8217;s so easy for us to forget how much there is to learn at first. Even if you happen to show up with a skill set that fits a contributor team&#8217;s needs exactly, you still have to learn where we collaborate, how distributed contribution works, and all these rules and guidelines about open source freedoms and copyleft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:10] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> And then also you have to come to terms with the fact that we define and design all of our spaces and programs with belonging in mind. I mean, for every one question that you get answered, there are going to be six new ones that you didn&#8217;t know you had yet. So I came away from a lot of these conversations with the reminder that it&#8217;s important in so many ways for us to talk about the work that we do, even when it&#8217;s boring, even when we think it doesn&#8217;t really matter, because a lot of people have questions about how this works, how it runs, and how they can be part of making sure that it&#8217;s around for the long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing that came up all over the place last week was how to communicate these things better. It&#8217;s easy to forget that folks who listen to this podcast don&#8217;t actually make up like a hundred percent of the people using WordPress; that&#8217;s on me. So just cause I&#8217;ve said here that, you know, enterprise is our next big space for biz dev or that, our primary growth markets are APAC, or that events are our best tool for brand expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> Like, just because I said it doesn&#8217;t mean that everyone heard it. And we absolutely have to get those messages to more people, more frequently, and with more certainty. You&#8217;ll hear often from WordPress pundits that rising tides lift all boats, and the bigger the pie, the more the slices. We believe fully in the spirit of coopetition here, that we are all better together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I can&#8217;t shake the feeling that we&#8217;re mostly just talking to ourselves about it. It&#8217;s hard to get outside our own little bubble, but I believe completely that doing so is the best thing for our project in the long term. Not only so that we can continue to grow and provide access to the opportunities we know we offer but also so that we can do more to dignify our profession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developers are not taken seriously, and yet you all are some of the smartest and most compassionate people I&#8217;ve ever met in my career. And I&#8217;d like to see how we can fix that perception together. And so that&#8217;s it. Those are the big, big, giant, old topics that came up a lot in conversation last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:14] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> Don&#8217;t forget that you can catch up on all the sessions via the live stream, or if you are feeling inspired to contribute, reach out to the community team and see what sorts of meetup events you can host.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:24] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:32] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things. I have two big things and one slightly less big thing, but they&#8217;re all fairly big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the first thing on the list is that the latest version of WordPress, WordPress 6.5, is on target for release on March 26th. That&#8217;s, I think, a couple weeks from now. So keep an eye out for that. In the event, I mean, we have auto-updates everywhere, and probably you are on a WordPress-specific host and, so you won&#8217;t necessarily need to do anything. But if you have any desire or concerns about seeing the software a little bit ahead of time, you can always go and download the beta, give it a quick test or the release candidate, give that a quick test. See if there&#8217;s anything that&#8217;s not functioning as you expected it to function, and let us know if it&#8217;s not. But yeah, there are auto-updates. You don&#8217;t have to go out and proactively do anything if you don&#8217;t want to, that&#8217;s just in case you do want to. That&#8217;s coming up March 26th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> The next thing is that I want to give everybody a general call-in for event contribution. So, WordPress events is where I entered the community. It is one of the most affirming and life-changing types of contribution I&#8217;ve ever done because you get to see a bunch of people succeed in their own goals because of something that you were able to tell them. It&#8217;s like teaching, but with people who elected to be there. So we have a lot of opportunities, for contribution by volunteering at events, either as volunteering at the event itself or to volunteer to organize it. We have small-scale, easy-to-do meetups, but we also have slightly larger WordCamps that can be done. If you have any hope for doing that or are just kind of interested. I&#8217;ll leave a link for you in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:19] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> And then the final thing on here is that we actually have a pretty substantial proposal out at the moment. It&#8217;s for non-editable footers on all event website pages. This might not sound interesting to you, but it actually is kind of interesting. So, it&#8217;s been proposed to add a non-editable footer to all of the event website pages moving forward. So that&#8217;s everything that would be displayed on a WordCamp or on any of the new formatted event sites that we have. This proposal intends to meet two goals. One, it fills any legal requirements a site or country might have about displaying the privacy policy and other items. And two, it brings visibility to the new events.WordPress.org website, where a community member can find more events in their area.&nbsp;The last day to respond to that proposal is March 20th, which I think is two days from now. I think it&#8217;s on Wednesday and this is airing on Monday. So, I&#8217;ll have a link to that in the show notes as well in case you have any thoughts about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:15] <strong><strong>Josepha</strong>:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. And if you like what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you ended up with questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.

This three-day event emerged as a vibrant celebration showcasing the collaboration, diversity, and innovation that drive the world&#8217;s most popular web platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asian WordPress flagship event started with a dedicated Contributor Day, followed by two days of engaging talks, panels, hands-on workshops, and networking. Notable guests, including WordPress Cofounder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a> and Executive Director <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, joined the diverse lineup of <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speakers/\">speakers</a>. Popular topics featured cutting-edge web technologies and trends, use cases, open source dynamics, and more. WordPress enthusiasts seized the opportunity to gain insights from international and local industry experts and to learn about the project&#8217;s future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Converting walled gardens into community gardens</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 8, Josepha Haden Chomphosy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/UK7FnaEeTrU?si=0H6eEEijj4tDWm_t&amp;t=30830\">took the stage</a> for an insightful journey comparing and contrasting the “walled” and “community” gardens in software ecosystems, drawing an analogy between closed and open source platforms. After exploring both concepts, she posed an important question to the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:2px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>What would it take for someone to move from a walled garden to a community garden?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:2px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source software, symbolized by community gardens, represents freedom from copyright restrictions and usage limitations. Unlike proprietary software (described as walled gardens), the core value lies in long-term empowerment, giving people control and ownership of their digital presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acknowledging the longstanding values held by WordPress and its open source community for two decades, Josepha focused on the importance of caring for foundations that make us strong, managing what distracts us, and nurturing growth by embracing new opportunities. She celebrated the strengths of the WordPress community and how its shared ethos furthers a thriving ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/03/wcasia-slide.png?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Slide from Josepha Haden Chomphosy\'s presentation showing colorful flowers on a blue background and the quote, &quot;To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow&quot; by Audrey Hepburn.\" class=\"wp-image-17066\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/03/wcasia-slide.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/03/wcasia-slide.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/03/wcasia-slide.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/03/wcasia-slide.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/03/wcasia-slide.png?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Quoting artist and activist Audrey Hepburn, Josepha expressed that, much like a community garden, the power of contributions—whether through time, knowledge, or product use— sustains and maintains shared spaces like WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/UK7FnaEeTrU?si=pjg0nkwla-d7mP69&amp;t=32274\">Q&amp;A portion</a> of her presentation, Josepha addressed inquiries about community involvement and contributions. Highlighted resources included the <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/\">WordPress job board</a> for opportunities within the ecosystem and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\">Data Liberation</a> project, emphasizing its role in fostering a more open web and helping the transition out of proprietary platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q&amp;A with Matt Mullenweg</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia concluded with a live audience Q&amp;A session featuring WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg.

Your brand is a mark of your unique value, so giving it more visibility helps you stand out, gives more credibility to your professional resume, and opens up a world of opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might already be thinking about your brand in your daily life, from the way you interact with your peers to the way you present yourself at networking events. But as we know, for a brand to be truly successful, it has to exist on the internet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do you even <em>start</em> building your personal brand in an online space where everyone is trying to do the same? The answer lies in choosing the right digital tools and platforms that help you hit your branding goals. There are thousands of tools, and not all of them will be right for your needs, which can be daunting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why, to help you in your branding efforts, we gathered the best online tools to streamline this process, ensuring your personal brand reflects your true Unique Value Proposition (USP) and gets the visibility it deserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Website creation tools</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website is the cornerstone of your brand. This is a given if you offer services or have an eCommerce platform, but if your brand centers around your online persona, you might be wondering whether you even need a website if you’re maintaining your social media profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media is powerful for building an audience – there’s no doubt about that. But in reality, a website is still the granddaddy of online presence because of its dynamic and highly customizable nature.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media platforms will confine you to work within their limitations, which means you will need to adapt your content style to what works best for their algorithms. It can be hard to present a proper biography, an overview of your work, and evergreen content on such platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a website can be whatever you want it to be – you are in full control of the way it looks and functions, and what content is posted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether showcasing a portfolio, hosting a blog, or highlighting services, your site is where long-lasting impressions are made, and an essential part of creating an effective website lies in picking the right tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Build your website on WordPress.com</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1308\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>WordPress.com homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a> is <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress\">the most popular Content Management System</a> (CMS), and it’s used by brands like <a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/\">Disney</a>, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>, and <a href=\"https://about.meta.com/\">Meta</a>. If you want to build a site with WordPress, we recommend choosing <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a> as your trusted hosting provider, as it comes with built-in security and analytics tools and automatic updates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the technicalities taken care of, you’ll have the time and opportunity to build a great site that fully reflects your personal brand and professional goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several tiers to WordPress.com, but the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/pricing/\">Creator plan</a> is the best option for professionals as it allows you to add unlimited plugins and themes. On the other hand, the integration with <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a> gives you essential tools to track engagement, monitor traffic sources, and understand your target audience&#8217;s demographics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1309\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>WordPress.com pricing</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Creator plan, it is very easy to get started, and if you’re serious about personal branding, having unlimited access to plugins and themes will be extremely helpful. Customize to your heart&#8217;s content with design options that resonate with your personal aesthetic, or extend functionality with plugins that offer everything from Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to social media integration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its automatic updates, scheduling abilities, and built-in analytics, WordPress.com lets you spend more time creating brand-centric content instead of worrying about admin tasks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Add eCommerce functionality with WooCommerce</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-2.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1310\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>WooCommerce homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the beautiful things about WordPress is that you can easily turn your website into an online store thanks to <a href=\"https://woo.com/\">WooCommerce</a> – the eCommerce platform <a href=\"https://barn2.com/blog/woocommerce-stats/#:~:text=The%20wordpress.org%20plugin%20repository,on%20the%20internet%20use%20WooCommerce.\">used by more than 4 million websites worldwide</a> to effectively sell their products and services online!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interactive commercial platform comes with many useful features, such as the option to add customer reviews to your product, build beautiful and categorized product galleries, upsell and cross-sell products and services, and fully customize product and checkout pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to branch out to eCommerce, we recommend opting for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/pricing/#:~:text=power%20of%20WooCommerce.-,Entrepreneur,-Build%20an%20online\">Entrepreneur plan</a> on WordPress.com, as it’s specially developed for people who want a full-fledged online store.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-3.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1311\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>WordPress.com pricing plans</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Build a newsletter</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Email marketing is powerful and still very popular among digital marketers. In fact, this marketing strategy is one of the most profitable, with a <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/804656/email-roi-perception/\">mind-boggling ROI of $36 for every dollar spent</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email gives you a direct line of communication with your audience and builds a longer-lasting relationship, which is especially true with newsletters. A periodic newsletter filled with interesting how-to guides, industry insights, or inspiring success stories not only provides immense value but also bolsters engagement with your brand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com includes a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/newsletter/\">newsletter feature</a> with every plan, and you can easily include one anywhere on your website by adding a “subscribe” block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1312\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>WordPress subscribe block</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The placement is very important, so we recommend putting this form above the fold on your homepage or as a call to action at the end of a compelling blog post to boost subscription rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"299\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-5.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1313\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example of placing a subscribe option above the fold</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This functionality allows you to convert your blog updates into rich, engaging newsletters. With no cap on the number of emails you can send, WordPress.com hands you the reins to grow your subscriber base unconstrained, unlike other platforms that may restrict your reach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides that, it also allows you to create gated content which is a strategy where exclusive content is provided to subscribers. The only thing you need to do is click on “Set up a paid plan” and a new window will pop up, allowing you to fully customize your paid newsletter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"430\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-6.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1314\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Creating a paid newsletter with WordPress</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature on WordPress.com helps you reward and retain your most loyal followers, cementing a strong community around your personal brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Unify your digital presence across all platforms with Gravatar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-7.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1315\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Gravatar homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When building your personal brand, you need to think of your online identity as a whole, not as different pieces independent of each other. Build your social media presence and blog as a cohesive online existence, which means syncing your information across platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> is an efficient tool that centralizes and streamlines your online identity across the web, powered by your email address.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting started with Gravatar is quick and user-friendly. With just a few steps, you’ll have a unique avatar that follows you from site to site, attaching a familiar face to your online commentary and interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-8.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1316\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example of a Gravatar profile&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of adjusting your profile for each platform, you’ll have a consistent identity everywhere, including important and up-to-date details such as contact information and events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A single digital signature allows you to build a consistent online identity, making your personal brand more memorable and credible. By unifying your digital presence, Gravatar alleviates the hassle of managing multiple logins and profiles. This convenience is not only a time-saver but ensures your online identity is uniform and professional.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you create your profile, you can fully customize it to fit your needs. Here are some of the great things you can do with Gravatar’s profile editor:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Finetune your profile background with custom colors and images. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-9.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1317\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adding a custom background image to your Gravatar profile</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Connect your verified social media accounts and other profiles. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-10.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1318\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Linking verified accounts to your Gravatar profile</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Add customized links to promote blog posts, featured articles, upcoming events, and products. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-11.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1319\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adding different links to your Gravatar profile</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Add your contact information so that people can easily get in touch. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-12.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1320\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adding contact information to your Gravatar profile</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is a QR code feature so you can quickly share your profile during networking events or put it on your physical business card. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"385\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-13.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1321\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>QR code options for Gravatar profiles</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the QR code, you can also generate a short link to put on your social media accounts, serving as a versatile “Link in bio” landing page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leverage the social media platforms that make sense for your brand</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We won’t go into too much detail about the different social media platforms, as you’re probably already aware of the most popular ones. But we do want to highlight two very important rules:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don’t worry about being everywhere. Instead, go where your target audience is.</strong> If you’re building your personal brand as an eCommerce leadership expert, chances are your most loyal audience is on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> rather than <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\">TikTok</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/?hl=bg\">Instagram</a>. On the other hand, if you’re a creative personality, like an artist or a musician, then social media platforms with a younger demographic would be a better place</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be consistent in your posting. </strong>This is a universal rule among social media – you won’t be successful if you’re inconsistent with your posting schedule. What helps here is to create a social media calendar and plan out your content for the next month or two. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing you should remember if you use various platforms is that you want to retain some level of consistency in terms of how you present yourself, and furthermore, it should be easy for people to recognize your personal profile across different profiles</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar can help you maintain this consistency by giving users a constantly updated overview of your professional identity, including a list of verified social media profiles like X/Twitter (the official one, not the fish one), TikTok, <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>, Instagram, <a href=\"https://bsky.social/\">Bluesky</a>, as well as your personal WordPress website, adding even more credibility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Create a podcast with Pocket Casts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"376\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-14.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1322\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Pocket Casts homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting a podcast can dramatically transform your personal brand by allowing you to engage with your audience on a more relational level, and they are a great way for you to share your expertise and talents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a marine biologist? Start a podcast about the weird fish people can find in their local area! Did you just start your own business? Share your adventure with other budding entrepreneurs and create a community of innovative minds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those ready to dip their toes or dive deep into the world of podcasting, <a href=\"https://pocketcasts.com/\">Pocket Casts</a> offers a user-friendly platform that caters to both novices and seasoned voices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pocket Casts is a comprehensive podcasting service that facilitates the creation and sharing of your series and plants your brand&#8217;s voice in the ears of an extensive audience worldwide. It also comes with a suite of analytics tools, giving you important insights about how audiences respond to your episodes so you can truly perfect your content strategy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other tools for content creation and sharing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistently creating great content is hard! Thankfully, there are plenty of tools to help you out at all stages of the content development process, like the organization and planning, ideation, creation, optimization, and promotion of the final product. With the right tools, you can create a workflow that is tailored to your needs and individual processes, allowing you to be consistent with your production.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tools for organization and content mapping</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/integrations/asana\">Notion</a> and <a href=\"https://asana.com/\">Asana</a> are great for content planning, each offering unique benefits that can result in a more polished and professional brand persona.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-15.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1323\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Notion and Asana integration</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notion&#8217;s all-encompassing workspace allows for meticulous planning, crafting, and cataloging of ideas, ensuring a brand&#8217;s narrative unfolds with precision. Asana guides the creative process with its strong project management tools, improving the content production and delivery process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, however, that the richness of features in <a href=\"https://asana.com/apps/notion-asana\">Notion and Asana</a> comes with a moderate learning curve, but there are many <a href=\"https://forum.asana.com/t/multiple-ways-to-integrate-asana-and-notion-2023-guide/482947\">useful resources by brands</a> and other users, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0rYATuSYnI\">especially on YouTube</a>, to help you get used to the tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, if you’re already familiar with the Gutenberg WordPress Editor, you shouldn’t have any issues with Notion, as their interfaces are very similar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Google Trends for ideation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-16.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1324\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Google Trends homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diving into <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/\">Google Trends</a>&#8216; ocean of insights reveals a highly valuable tool that offers a glimpse into the collective consciousness. By leveraging such data, brands can adjust their content to match audience interests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interpreting the peaks and valleys of trending topics leads to informed decisions that anchor a content strategy in the present. For instance, a digital marketer might spot an emerging trend in sustainable living and weave this theme into their blog articles, social media posts, and podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Image and video editor tools</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a study by the US Chambers of Commerce, <a href=\"https://gitnux.org/branding-statistics/#:~:text=The%20US%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce,recognition%20by%20up%20to%2080%25.\">55% of first impressions of brands are visual</a>, which is another proof of how important your visual representation is. It needs to be engaging, unique, and, most importantly, represent your personal values and best qualities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone is a designer but thankfully, there are tools to help every single professional to create a consistent visual brand. One of the most prominent platforms to do that is <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/en_gb/\">Canva</a>, which offers a library of templates, photos, and illustrations that can be customized to align with your personal brand’s visual theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-17.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1325\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Canva design tool homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canva Pro, the premium version, extends these capabilities with additional features like brand kits and background removal, providing an even more tailored design experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For people looking to enhance their video editing skills, <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html\">Adobe Premiere Rush</a> is a free mobile and desktop app that offers various features to help your brand grow. Its built-in camera, for example, allows for high-quality video capture, while intuitive editing tools help edit and share from anywhere, ensuring your visual narrative remains cohesive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"386\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-18.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1326\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adobe Premiere Rush homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For budding personal brands, this tool simplifies the creation of professional-looking content that can resonate with audiences across various platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>URL Shorteners</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>URLs can be very long which makes the process of integrating them troublesome and not aesthetically pleasing. To resolve this, you can use a URL shortener. These are smart tools that allow you to create custom links with your brand name and can also track engagement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great URL-shortening tool is <a href=\"https://www.rebrandly.com/\">Rebrandly</a> – an AI platform with more than 100 popular integrations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-19.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1327\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rebrandly homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It works by selecting a relevant domain name related to your brand and using it as a consistent base for all your short links. This practice not only reinforces brand visibility but also offers detailed analytics insights to evaluate the effectiveness of your shared content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using these analytics can transform raw data into strategic action. By examining click patterns and traffic sources, you can fine-tune your content scheduling and distribution strategies to better capture your audience&#8217;s attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Monitor and refine your results with analytics tools</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a personal brand is a continuous process, and analytical tools can provide you with helpful performance indicators. These tools clarify which areas of your personal branding strategy are thriving and which require refinement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those just starting out on their personal branding journey, focusing on key analytics like engagement rate, follower growth over time, and website conversions can be incredibly insightful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most social media platforms come with their own analytics dashboards that show metrics such as engagement rates, best-performing content by reach, and follower demographics. These data points highlight which content truly resonates with your audience, informing not only what you create but also how you can create deeper connections. You can then use these insights by experimenting with content types and posting times, and then measure the changes in engagement for continuous improvement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, when open rates for your newsletter seem low, consider A/B testing with different subject lines or content structures. Track the subsequent open and click-through rates to identify the most engaging approach, thus maintaining a dynamic and relevant correspondence with your audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to website analytics, <a href=\"https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?service=analytics&passive=1209600&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.google.com%2Fanalytics%2Fweb%2F%23&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.google.com%2Fanalytics%2Fweb%2F&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin\">Google Analytics</a> is the industry standard. However, for WordPress users, <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/\">Jetpack</a> offers an accessible alternative and it’s included in both the Creator and Entrepreneur plans with WordPress.com. It provides intuitive metrics such as daily visitors, page views, and top-performing pages, all critical in gauging the traction of your online content without the daunting complexity of Google&#8217;s service.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"362\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-20.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1328\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jetpack homepage</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conclude each analysis session with a commitment to apply what you&#8217;ve learned. Set regular intervals for review – be it weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly – to ensure your personal brand remains vibrant and effective. Remember, consistent analysis is a foundational practice that nurtures a strong and resonant personal brand, keeping you one step ahead in the exciting world of online branding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Create a personal brand that stands out with Gravatar&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating and maintaining your personal brand is a lot of work, but don’t be discouraged!

Initially a training service, Pootlepress has become a product focused company known for its WordPress plugins. Jamie&#8217;s depth of experience in the industry is increasingly overshadowed by his visibility as a YouTuber, where, as you&#8217;ll hear, much of his attention is now focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we&#8217;ll cover some new ground. We talk about a critical issue facing WordPress today, the fierce competition from platforms like Canva and Wix, and the marketing hurdles that WordPress must navigate to maintain its market share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also explore Jamie&#8217;s unconventional path to becoming a content creator, discussing how he went from teaching tennis to teaching tech, and how he&#8217;s leveraged YouTube to grow his audience and business. His perspective is that it&#8217;s important to make technical concepts accessible and easy to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making his content is a lot of work, most of which happens behind the scenes. We get into this a little more deeply, and Jamie shares his strategies for effective video creation, from planning to execution, along with his thoughts on sponsored content and its place in the YouTube ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the future of WordPress, content creation, or the dynamics of digital learning this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Jamie Marsland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Jamie Marsland. Hi Jamie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:08] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Hey there. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very good. Thank you for joining me today. If you haven&#8217;t checked out what Jamie&#8217;s been doing, Jamie has had a really interesting career in the WordPress space. We&#8217;re going to talk about that. We&#8217;ll talk about his YouTube channel, and how he&#8217;s managed to grow that over the last couple of years. Before we do that Jamie, I wonder if you could introduce yourself, give us your quick WordPress bio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:29] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> So quick WordPress bio. I&#8217;ve been running this business, Pootlepress for 14 years. Prior to that though, I had a corporate career in technical, both public businesses and private businesses, running businesses. But always in publishing, and in software publishing. I always say that because people just see me as a YouTuber these days, so I want people to understand there&#8217;s a bit more background to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the last 14 years, I&#8217;ve been running Pootlepress. And we started off as a training business, and then we morphed into a product business. Built some plugins, which we still provide. And then over the last three years, I&#8217;ve been committing to creating content, primarily over YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Tell us a little bit about Pootlepress. What were the bits and pieces that you got yourself involved in? And are you a coder? Do you write the code, or did you write the code yourself? Do any of those projects still have a life, or have they been shelved for now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:16] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> As I said, it started off as a training business, which was literally, I left my previous job. I&#8217;d introduced WordPress into that business, and we had a very expensive development team. We were running a different CMS, which nobody would&#8217;ve heard of, it was called Ektron. But it was about $5,000 per site, per year, so it was, you know, in terms of WordPress. But that was at the very low end of the CMS market. But in terms of WordPress, which is obviously free, it was much more expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I introduced WordPress into that business. I could sort of see the market was shaking out a bit. And I looked at the WordPress market from that job, and seeing what was going on. And there were people running training courses in WordPress, but they were charging £500 a day for a WordPress training course, and selling them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I thought, that&#8217;s quite interesting. But they were going after the sort of corporate market. When I left that business, they gave me a chunk of money, and so I had some time. So I thought, well, I could start a WordPress training business. And so I took out a Google ad, and I launched a WordPress training course, because I knew WordPress really well, because I&#8217;d been using it personally for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I pitched a course, I think it was £99, or something like that. And within half a day I got my first order. I thought, well that&#8217;s interesting, there&#8217;s a market here. And then I ended up running 2 courses a week, with about 15 people in, traveling around the country. I ran them in London, where I&#8217;m based in Chatham. Ended up in Scotland, also Wales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So all around the country, running these face-to-face training courses, with people in a room, training people on WordPress. And there&#8217;s nothing quite like seeing face-to-face people using WordPress to understand, I&#8217;m going to talk about the product business in a minute, but understand some of the issues people have with WordPress, when you&#8217;re actually training them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve traveled a lot of miles, and personally trained thousands of people now on WordPress, which is just an incredible experience to have, which you don&#8217;t actually realise until you&#8217;ve sort of gone through it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, from that, we built some plugins, and we&#8217;re going back a while now. So we built some plugins around Woo, as they were, Woo Themes. And, yeah, those plugins are still going, and we still have customers, and they&#8217;re actively supported. And the plugins now we&#8217;re releasing are Gutenberg based, I guess you&#8217;d say. So block based plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were there right at the start of that. So we have a free plugin called Caxton, which nobody understands, but it&#8217;s named after William Caxton. If you&#8217;re English, you probably know that. He was a, the equivalent of Gutenberg but English. And that was launched in Nashville, which Matt Mullenweg demoed actually, as part of his presentation of the launch of Gutenberg. So we were right there, right at the start of Gutenberg. So I&#8217;ve always understood that Gutenberg was going to be a big driver in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds like there&#8217;s a common thread running through quite a bit of that, which is educator basically. Do you have a sort of traditional background in education, or is it just something you find yourself drawn towards and capable of doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:50] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well, I was a tennis coach when I was 19 to 23, to help fund uni education, partly. So played a lot of tennis. And I loved coaching, I loved teaching. And looking back on that experience, that was like, okay, that&#8217;s quite an interesting thing. So I&#8217;m thinking of redoing my, they lapse tennis coaching qualifications, I&#8217;m thinking of retaking them, and going back to it at some point. Because I absolutely love teaching. You realise this as you go through this career, but I love the teaching bit of it, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you find there&#8217;s any, the same level of love for the online teaching? Because when you described your WordPress teaching, it sounded like you were in the room with the people. And so you obviously get that immediate feedback and, you know, it&#8217;s not done via an email saying, thank you, I enjoyed your course, or whatever. You&#8217;re actually seeing people&#8217;s faces light up and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with the YouTube content, and all of the other bits and pieces, I just wonder if there&#8217;s any connection between your end users, your students, if you like. Do you get that same warm and fuzzy feeling?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:45] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, definitely is, because the videos on YouTube get tons of comments these days, and I get loads of personal emails, and it&#8217;s the same with teaching people in a room. You know, you teach people in a room and you literally, it sounds a bit overblown, but people do email you and say, this is, you know, I&#8217;ve built a business out of this teaching, thank you. And it&#8217;s changed the direction of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you definitely get that, it&#8217;s different on YouTube, but you definitely get that. Comments are fantastic, and the likes are fantastic as well. So yeah, I mean you do get that sense of fulfillment with it. And I think there&#8217;s, part of it is, tennis coaching is a really, you can teach people to play tennis properly very quickly. You see a lot of people, what I&#8217;m getting to is, I think there&#8217;s lots of ways to teach people well, which I think is a real interest of mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, how you can take a subject, and simplify it down to core elements, so they get the basics and start flying very quickly. With tennis, there&#8217;s like three things you can teach any beginner, to get them playing decent tennis within half an hour, no problem. But you see a lot of coaches will overcomplicate things and people won&#8217;t have the same improvement so quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s the real challenge in WordPress education as well. So I put a huge amount of thought into how I structure my videos in terms of, so people are going to be able to understand them, and do things more easily than just, this is this, this is this, this and this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in terms of my videos, huge amount goes into the preparation of planning how to lay them out, to try and get the best possible outcome for the end user. Whilst at the same time, with YouTube, you have to make them engaging enough that they&#8217;re going to click on the thing in the first place to watch it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot. There&#8217;s kind of multidimensional, creating YouTube videos. You want to be educational, but if you just do a tutorial video, nobody&#8217;s going to potentially watch it, because it&#8217;s going to be boring as heck. So there&#8217;s multi-layers to doing YouTube education stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But you don&#8217;t have like a traditional, I don&#8217;t know, pedagogy. You haven&#8217;t got a, like a teacher training qualification, or anything like that? You&#8217;ve just learned over time the process of creating something that is what you wish to create. And obviously, now that you&#8217;ve got this huge uptick in your subscriber count on the YouTube channel, you&#8217;ve obviously hit on some formula which is working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> And I actually don&#8217;t think the traditional approach works on YouTube anyway. I don&#8217;t think you can take, you can try, but I don&#8217;t think if you take a traditional teaching approach, and stick it on YouTube, it&#8217;s not going to work. So I wouldn&#8217;t, you know, if I was putting a video on the Learn WordPress website, I wouldn&#8217;t put that same video on YouTube, because it&#8217;s a completely different context that people are consuming that information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So back in the day when you stumbled across WordPress in the business that you were working with, you probably had no intuition that it was going to work out quite so well, in terms of WordPress&#8217;s ascendancy in the CMS market. How do you feel about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re obviously at this pivotal point, where it feels that there&#8217;s maybe a little bit of slowdown in adoption. We keep talking about this number, this 43% of the internet. I can&#8217;t quite work out what that means, but it&#8217;s a big number. You know, it&#8217;s a giant proportion of the internet. Do you have any intuitions as to whether or not that&#8217;s going to keep going? Would it bother you in any way if it didn&#8217;t keep rising?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:33] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> A few things there, one is, when I was just starting off in WordPress, I could see it was going to fly, because it was starting to gain momentum. But I had all the same, you know, my developers were .net developers that were working for me. They were object orientated focused. They looked at PHP as some sort of dirt in the road, and they thought WordPress was terrible. So they&#8217;re very sneering about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has led a lot of the, I guess, teaching I do as well. You know, there&#8217;s a lot of, people will dismiss WordPress still, for not being, what I&#8217;m trying to say is, WordPress has never won out because it&#8217;s been the best CMS. It&#8217;s won out because of the ecosystem, and the other market drivers that were driving it. Like there were CMSs that had amazing workflows, editorial workflows, back in the day, and WordPress didn&#8217;t have any of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But WordPress won out because of the huge ecosystem, and the fact it was open source, and all these other drivers that were driving it. So I could sort of see that it was going to work back then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of where we are now, it&#8217;s not so much the market size that&#8217;s important to me. There was a slide shared by Noel Tock, as part of his keynote at WordCamp Asia. It was a fascinating slide actually, and it talked about market share, which we know is about 43%, and leveling off a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then he overlaid that slide with search interest. So he looked at how many people were searching. And actually had a really interesting Twitter dialogue with Alex Denning about this as well. And that was basically showing how it grew in 2014, and then now its dived down quite steeply over the last, I think four years, in terms of search interest. So people aren&#8217;t searching for it so much. And then he also overlaid that with number of sites that are being built, which has also gone down a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that, for me, is probably the most important metric, yeah. So that has gone down significantly as well, from where we were at the peak. And then he also overlaid that with another metric, which was maturity of sector. So in terms of how many people are actually engaged in building WordPress sites, or producing WordPress products. And that was kind of still going up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we&#8217;ve potentially got here is the confluence of a declining market, which we&#8217;re not seeing quite yet. This is the kind of worst case scenario, with over suppliers. So if that is the case, if we do start to see some of that over the next few years, that&#8217;s going to cause a lot of pain to people, because we&#8217;re going to have a declining market, in terms of number sites being built. But we&#8217;ve got lots and lots of suppliers, lots of product people in that sector. So essentially not enough business for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who knows, that&#8217;s conjecture. But my spidey senses are telling me, this is possibly where we&#8217;re potentially at. And I think, if you look at the strategy, there&#8217;s a few other things that play into my mind for this as well. One is, I was at Cloudfest last week in Germany, and a lot of the hosting companies now are pitching towards, deliberately, strategically, pitching towards the agency developer market. That&#8217;s where they&#8217;re going. And there&#8217;s two reasons for that, potential reasons for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is, that&#8217;s where people spend the most money. The second reason for that is, they&#8217;re seeing a contraction of the DIY market, which would be my guess as well. So they&#8217;re seeing their overall market go down, in terms of revenue, my guess. But they&#8217;re seeing everyone trying to go after the agency developer market. Everyone that I speak to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a conversation with Wix this week, because I&#8217;ve had a demo of their product. They are deliberately going after the agency market as well. So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just WordPress that are seeing this pinch at the moment, because I think there&#8217;s some recessional pressure on that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do think it&#8217;s potentially an issue for WordPress, that we&#8217;re, it&#8217;s a question of what is the canary in the mine? And I&#8217;m seeing some of those signals. So yeah, I&#8217;ve got some trepidation of where the market is going to head over the next few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I plumb a little bit further into that, and ask you what the signals are, if you&#8217;re willing to share them? The signals that you&#8217;ve said that you were able to see. Just moments ago, you said that you had this, whatever the canary in the mine was. And you had a few little signals that you thought were illustrative of the general argument that you were making. Can you share those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:13] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well, it was just those really. It just the fact that I&#8217;m seeing all the hosting companies that I&#8217;m talking to, because I talk to a lot of hosting companies, and we&#8217;ll probably come on to talk about wordpress.com. But everyone seems to have a strategy of going after the developer agency market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone I speak to, that&#8217;s their strategy. Which makes sense, but it&#8217;s kind of interesting that it seems like that&#8217;s the direction of travel right now. And I don&#8217;t have insider information, in terms of the numbers for hosting companies. That&#8217;s just my view from the outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s been a lot of talk recently. Well, certainly over the last three or four years, from various different quarters, all about the sort of shattering of the community. And I think it was, maybe it was Joost, the person, as opposed to Yoast the company. Or maybe it was Marieke, I can&#8217;t remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea that the community is sort of heading in two different directions. You&#8217;ve got this philanthropic side of the community, who pour lots and lots of their personal free time into the project, and wish it to grow in that way. And then you&#8217;ve got the other side, which is driven more by profit, and about how these two sides, in their estimation at least anyway, are getting further and further apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so they&#8217;re having to shout across this void. And the void gets further and further, so that the shouting has to be done louder and louder. The takeaway from that, I guess is that, if you&#8217;ve got a community which isn&#8217;t working, those two sides are not working in tandem, that&#8217;s also a problem I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. It was also interesting, because at Cloudfest, lots of hosting companies were there, because Joost was there actually. I was chatting to him and he was saying, actually one of the interesting things is that they need WordPress to succeed. If these like Wix, and Squarespace, and Shopify, if those guys start winning out, that&#8217;s going to affect the hosting company&#8217;s revenue as well. Because those are closed systems, that don&#8217;t host on their systems. There&#8217;s a lot at play in making WordPress work really, at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. He wrote a piece just the other day on the Post Status blog, all about how the hosting companies are, well, in many cases they&#8217;ve got their own onboarding system, and they&#8217;ve got their own page builder, or something adjacent to a page builder. And I think his central argument was, would it be a good idea if, rather than having these sort of rival system, so if you go with hosting company x, you&#8217;re tied in because you&#8217;ve bought into their package, and you understand their tooling and what have you. And if you go with hosting company y, you&#8217;re locked in over there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think his central argument was, we need WordPress to succeed, not the proprietary bits and pieces within your own systems. And in order to do that, would it be a good idea to spend less on your proprietary things, and put that investment back into, I don&#8217;t know, Five for the Future or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:34] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s a fair point. The onboarding of WordPress has been mooted a few times in the last few weeks as well. And it&#8217;s one of the big, when you train people, you realise there&#8217;s many hurdles of friction in terms of WordPress, which it&#8217;d be great to have solved, like domain names and hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you go to a hosting page, and that&#8217;s the first hurdle. You&#8217;re like, you get the average person and. Well, you compare the experience of setting up a website on Canva, and setting up a website through any WordPress host. And Canva, it&#8217;s five minutes and they, my cats could do it frankly, it&#8217;s so easy. Whereas WordPress, you have pricing tables with all sorts of things in, which are like object cash and, oh, what was that? Do I need some of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a world of difference in terms of the friction between WordPress and some of these no-code solutions out there. And I know historically, WordPress has always batted these things off. My worry is that might not last forever, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s probably where it needs to be. That&#8217;s the competition. I had this conversation with the head of Influencer Marketing at Wix. They&#8217;ve got 500 people in marketing at Wix. I think they&#8217;ve got 200 on the influencer, no, that can&#8217;t be right. But they&#8217;ve signed up about 400 influencers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:37] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> And I know we always talk about Wix, and the fact that they put huge amounts of money into marketing. But you compare that to WordPress, who historically have been development companies, with the odd marketing person appended on the side of it. And they&#8217;re really serious. They&#8217;re really serious, and they&#8217;ve got this, quite a cool product that&#8217;s aimed at agency market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do think that the opposition is lining up their ducks really well at the moment. If you were doing a competitor analysis, you look at, you know, I think Canva is a competitor to the brochure market. I&#8217;ve been saying this for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve got a website builder. If they want to, they can go after a lot of the brochure market, which is a lot of WordPress business. Wix, doing some really cool stuff with their Wix Studio stuff. It&#8217;s really slick. Obviously Shopify, going great guns. And then you compare this to WordPress at the moment. I worry how quickly WordPress can react.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say I was watching your WP Builds chat today, and you were saying, what happens if it goes down to 40 and then 35? Let&#8217;s say, that did happen. Is WordPress match fit to react to that? And my worry is, at the moment, we are not, because we haven&#8217;t had to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a really interesting point, isn&#8217;t it? We literally haven&#8217;t had to be. It&#8217;s been growth, upon growth, upon growth, year on year. And obviously these rival platforms, Wix et al, they&#8217;ve obviously also had growth year, on year, on year. It hasn&#8217;t been of the same magnitude, but in terms of finance, and the bottom line, it has been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if they can employ a sophisticated marketing team, that can put adverts, you know, in the Super Bowl and things like that, then that&#8217;s going to be a very difficult hurdle to overcome. Because if people do stop Googling for WordPress, or it just, you know, the mind share just disappears, and whenever somebody thinks about a website, that little three letter word pops out of everybody&#8217;s mouth. Oh yeah, Wix, I&#8217;ve heard of that. That&#8217;s going to be hard to compete with. And I think you&#8217;re right, interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:31] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> If you compare brand searches, I mean, Canva is the big one. Canva completely dwarfs. You know, I think actually, if I was Wix, I&#8217;d be scared silly of Canva, frankly. I think Canva is such a behemoth in terms of it&#8217;s got, I think it&#8217;s got 165 million monthly users now. Generating cash, always been profitable, and people have grown up with it, people are using it. So, you know, my kids know how to build a website, because they&#8217;ve used Canva. And it&#8217;s the same interface, so there&#8217;s no learning curve. So, personally, I think Canva, if they wanted to, they could go and eat a lot of the Squarespace, and a lot of the Wix market, and a lot of the WordPress brochure market, if they wanted to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canva have got an event coming up. The Canva Create event, which is titled Changing Work, or something like that. So we&#8217;ll see if they, because they have a, like a one page website builder in Canva at the moment. Pretty slick. You can only build a one page website, so it&#8217;s very limited. If they extend that, then that&#8217;s going to be a really interesting thing to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You clearly are fairly optimistic. Well, I say you are, obviously we&#8217;ve just had the conversation that we&#8217;ve just had. But, given the content that you are creating, I suppose there must be a part of you which is optimistic about WordPress&#8217;s future as well. Because your YouTube channel, and we will link to everything that we mention in the show notes, so you can check that out on the WP Tavern website. We&#8217;ll link to all of Jamie&#8217;s bits and pieces, properties and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;ve been creating a YouTube channel. I don&#8217;t know quite how far that goes back. But I think it&#8217;s fair to say that, at the moment, you&#8217;ve got lots of heads turning in your direction. The subscriber count is on a fairly rapid rise. So bravo, well done for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the content, that I&#8217;ve seen at least anyway, is very much aligned with kind of Core WordPress. What can WordPress out the box do, without needing to bundle a bunch of plugins? So given that you are doing that, you must have some confidence in its capacity to challenge the likes of Wix and Squarespace, or maybe not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:22] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I mean it&#8217;s miles ahead of those things at the moment. It is important to say that, in terms of how many people are using it, and market share. I was just talking about where I look at it from a, if we were starting today, where we&#8217;re at in terms of just the marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think WordPress is in a place where it needs to step up a gear, which it&#8217;s doing. And that&#8217;s partly why I&#8217;m optimistic about it. So, you know, my videos, a lot of them are like, I do some website recreations where I take a famous website, and I show you how to rebuild it using just Core WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m hugely optimistic about it. It&#8217;s got some hurdles to get over. But the core, imagine if we didn&#8217;t have Gutenberg right now. Imagine where we&#8217;d be if we didn&#8217;t have Gutenberg. I know there&#8217;s lots of people that don&#8217;t like Gutenberg, but imagine that situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually also, interestingly, WordPress has doubled, and I&#8217;m not saying this is down to Gutenberg, but it&#8217;s doubled its market share since Gutenberg was released. So at the very least, it hasn&#8217;t harmed the growth of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the content that you are creating is around the block editor, and what have you. I&#8217;d love to get into the process of that, because your videos, and again, pause this, go and watch some of Jamie&#8217;s content. You&#8217;ll know what I&#8217;m talking about as soon as you&#8217;ve got three minutes into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You obviously put a real value on quality. I&#8217;m imagining there&#8217;s quite a lot of editing and retakes, and all of that. You&#8217;ve mentioned before that you spend a long time planning everything out. Why are you doing this? What is the point of having a YouTube channel? What do you get out of it, aside from the pleasure that you may derive? What&#8217;s your north star with that project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:44] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, well, originally it was just to create some content that kind of countered the narrative that you couldn&#8217;t do stuff in the block editor, I think, probably. So I just started producing some content just with, I guess a slight experiment, I suppose. And then it started to get some traction and feedback, so I carried on. I just carried on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was actually a post by Chris Lema, that talked about trying to become a content machine. I think it was something like that. Which kind of inspired me to really start committing towards it. And I could just sense that there was something happening in terms of creating the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s got to the point where it&#8217;s generating revenue. It&#8217;s generating more revenue than the other bits of the business, which wasn&#8217;t the plan. But then people start emailing you and saying, well, we&#8217;d like to sponsor this. We&#8217;d like to put our name to this content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last two contracts I&#8217;ve signed, in terms of the description of what it was, one had talent in quotes at the top, which is bizarre. And the other had influencer, which is really bizarre. And now that&#8217;s driving revenue. It&#8217;s driving revenue back to the product business, and it&#8217;s driving revenue back to the training business. That was not the intention of why I started it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s really fascinating. So it was just done out of a desire to put content out there. It transformed itself into something that was getting the eyeballs. And then I presume, off the back of that, yeah, the sponsorship, emails start arriving and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A difficult decision must have been had, or a difficult decision must have been, had to have been made at some point. How much time does Jamie put into this in the future, you know? Okay, it&#8217;s successful now. Will it continue to grow? Should I be concentrating on the business? Should I be concentrating on the videos? Yeah, I guess you&#8217;ve got to sit the family down and have that conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:21] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well it&#8217;s a bit strange to say, you know, when you&#8217;re 50, what do you do for a living? And you have to say, I&#8217;m a YouTuber. It was hard enough to explain to my mother what I did in WordPress, and now it&#8217;s, she just looks at me blankly like I&#8217;m crazy. But I think the other thing is, I absolutely love it. So it wasn&#8217;t like I was drawn to the challenge of creating interesting creative content, and that was the prime thing that got me to create lots of video content. I absolutely love the creative process, and challenge of creating video content. So it was like, oh okay, this is maybe what I should have been doing a while back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Does the sponsorship bring with it a different approach to creating content? What I mean by that is, when you were just doing the content because you enjoyed doing the content, you could put things out on any schedule, I guess. You know, miss a month, it doesn&#8217;t matter, it was just a bit of fun. But then as soon as the sponsorships start to come in, I guess you&#8217;ve got to be a bit more methodical about it, bit more timely about it, and they&#8217;re going to want a return on that investment. So has it changed your opinion of it, as a thing that you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:21] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Not yet, but I&#8217;m quite early into it, so ask me maybe in a couple of years time. And I think the thing with the sponsorship, all the sponsored content I&#8217;m doing so far is stuff that I&#8217;ve pitched it to them actually, a lot of it. Even though people will email me a lot these days, and ask for sponsored content. I&#8217;ll often have ideas of an interesting piece of content, and then, because I know most people in the WordPress market now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And having a YouTube channel is a great way to network, by the way. So you know, for example, a good example is with the guys over at Stellar. I&#8217;ve done a few pieces with them. But I had the idea, wouldn&#8217;t it be great fun to do a piece of content which was, I think we&#8217;re going to call it, I hired an ethical hacker to break into my website and here&#8217;s what happened. You know, which is like a really interesting idea as a piece of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve actually found an ethical hacker, he&#8217;s based in Malaga, and I&#8217;m going to go and see him, and that&#8217;ll be part of the video as well. The interesting thing about the sponsorship is how you take an idea and make it interesting, and compelling for people watching the content, so they still want to watch it. That&#8217;s a really creative challenge as well. But in terms of, it hasn&#8217;t changed my opinion yet, but I&#8217;m very early to the financial bit of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well let&#8217;s hope you still maintain the enthusiasm. What does the process look like then? You mentioned that you&#8217;ve come up with some innovative titles, and you&#8217;re obviously telephoning people up, and trying to find hackers here, there, and everywhere. But what is the process, to put out a half an hour, an hour long piece of content? Just give us an insight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I think everybody has the impression that, oh, YouTube, it&#8217;s easy. There, he&#8217;s staring at the camera, he&#8217;s talking, he&#8217;s making it up as he goes along. And I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not like that. I&#8217;m sure there must be hours, and hours, and hours. What does it take to put out one of your videos?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:49] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> As an example, I&#8217;ve got a video coming out today with wordpress.com. It&#8217;s a five minute video and it probably took two days. That sort of magnitude. There&#8217;s like the initial idea, and then I always, always now, get the title and thumbnail sorted first. If anyone&#8217;s going to do this stuff, you&#8217;ve got to do that first with YouTube. It sounds a bit crass, but you&#8217;ve just got to do it. So get the packaging right. And I think only once you&#8217;ve got that right do you know the video&#8217;s going to fly. So that&#8217;s a really good process to go through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it&#8217;s just around, planning is everything, and the creative idea behind the flow of the video. I&#8217;ve developed a blueprint now, which I use on a lot of my videos, which is about having a hook, and then adding loops into the video, so you keep people engaged throughout the video. So it&#8217;s almost like this layer that you layer on top of a video. So when you&#8217;re seeing the video, you&#8217;re seeing somebody talk about something, but actually there&#8217;s hopefully a blueprint behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s a story in there somewhere. There&#8217;s a methodology behind it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:39] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> That is getting natural to me now. So when I&#8217;m planning videos, I understand, I don&#8217;t have to think. When you first start doing YouTube, you have to think about everything like that, because it&#8217;s not natural. It is to some people, but it&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t to me. So you&#8217;ve got to plan it, in terms of that blueprint. How to structure it. Hook people at the start, keep them engaged throughout, plus educate them along the journey. So there&#8217;s quite a lot going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Do you do sponsor bits inside the video? What I mean is, is the sponsorship clearly defined in the content that you do? So there&#8217;s an ad for hosting company x, or whatever it may be. And then you get back to being in the video, it&#8217;s Jamie talking to the camera and what have you. Or are you open to creating sponsored videos about particular product or company?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:17] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> So both really. So at the moment I&#8217;ve got pre-rolls that go on the front of all my videos, which is, at the moment, InstaWP are sponsoring that space. But I&#8217;ve also done videos where I do website recreation, with certain tools. So I&#8217;ve done one with Kadence and GiveWP, where I recreated the Charity Water website using their tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they give me a challenge, and I try and rebuild it using Kadence and their tools. And I did one with Spectra One as well. So that&#8217;s kind of how that works. The one I&#8217;m doing with Stellar and SolidWP will be, it&#8217;ll be sponsored by them and it&#8217;s going to be, this is the challenge, but this is what happens when we try and hack into a website without any security, this is what happens when we try and hack into a website with some security. It kind of varies in a way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so you&#8217;ve got a, you can, approach Jamie if you want to make content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:01] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> And I&#8217;ve also got, if you go to my YouTube sponsorship page, I&#8217;ve also got this series of videos going on at the moment where we give my daughters a challenge with a product. We&#8217;ve got five people lined up actually, who have signed up. And the first one we did was Kadence AI. So, can Meg and Lily build a website in 10 minutes, using Kadence AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s another sponsorship opportunity as well. And that&#8217;s them using the Kadence tools to try and do a task, and we just film them doing the task. And I think that&#8217;s really interesting from a content point of view, but it&#8217;s also really interesting from a product point of view. Because they&#8217;re beginners, they&#8217;re not web pros, how beginners use their plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s really fascinating, and you get your family involved as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:37] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well they get the money actually with that one as well, because they&#8217;re both at universities now. I&#8217;ve got another daughter called Hetty who wants in on the action, she hasn&#8217;t done it yet. But yeah, the money goes to them to fund their accommodation at uni, which is really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is so nice. That&#8217;s so great. One thing that we should mention is, of course, and you did mention it before. But you know you&#8217;re doing something right. Well, you didn&#8217;t mention this bit before, but you know you&#8217;re doing something right when people such as Matt Mullenweg drop your name in the State of the Word. And off the back of, I guess being seen by Matt, you&#8217;re now creating content, or you&#8217;re about to create content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:11] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ve done three, fourth one going out today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So this is wordpress.com. You&#8217;re making videos in that space. How&#8217;s that process going? Are you enjoying that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:19] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s great. Basically it&#8217;s a series of videos called Build and Beyond. So I&#8217;m partnering with them for a series of videos, kind of aimed at the sort of developer agency market again, which is interesting. Because there&#8217;s lots of stuff going on in wordpress.com that people don&#8217;t know about. So it&#8217;s trying to show some of that stuff, but also just kind of speak to the broader market about the cool stuff you can do with WordPress actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And obviously I&#8217;ve got resources of some amazing people in wordpress.com to lean on, in creating content. It&#8217;s kind of like a fabulous thing to happen. And obviously it&#8217;s great from my point of view, because it gets my name on wordpress.com, I&#8217;m on their blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And hopefully it&#8217;s adding value to their brand, which is the idea. Part of my plan with that is to kind of shine a light on some of the cool stuff happening in WordPress, in the broader community. So hopefully a video&#8217;s going out in a few hours, which talks about some of the developers you should follow in the WordPress ecosystem. It&#8217;s trying to shine a light on the cool stuff that&#8217;s happening out there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I don&#8217;t quite know how to phrase this question. I&#8217;ll ask it, and maybe I&#8217;ll change the wording of it. Do you think there&#8217;s something different about you. Do you think the route to success, in the way that you are doing it with WordPress content, do you think that&#8217;s something you were born with, if you know what I mean? Do you have that capacity? Were you always able to be a raconteur? Can you control the room? Have you always had the ability to talk? Do you understand kind of where I&#8217;m going? Do you believe that this is something that anybody could do with a little bit of hard work and patience, or is there something a bit special about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:39] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> There&#8217;s nothing special about me, but there&#8217;s definitely, a lot of my roles in, especially before Pootlepress, were being the communicator between the technical people, and the commercial people. I was that person that could take technical ideas, and then translate them to non-technical people, so they could understand from a business point of view why they were important to do. So I&#8217;ve definitely enjoyed being in that spot, taking really complex ideas, and make simple for people to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it also takes a certain amount courage to push through with something like this. Because the idea of putting things out, and thinking, well, I&#8217;ve made it, people will watch it. That takes a certain level of courage I think, because it&#8217;s easy to think that people will watch it, feel great disappointment if they don&#8217;t. But in your case, it didn&#8217;t turn out that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:22] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> No. We have this running joke with my wife, which is, there&#8217;s three types of people in the world. People that think they&#8217;re worse than they actually are. People think they&#8217;re about right, in terms of their opinion of themself, and people that think they&#8217;re better than they actually are. My wife thinks she&#8217;s slightly worse than, she&#8217;s got far more talent than she thinks she has. I think I&#8217;m probably slightly above, which I think helps in this space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think that&#8217;s great. Thank you for joining me today, Jamie. It&#8217;s been a real pleasure. It&#8217;s been an absolute delight watching your videos, and watching your popularity grow. Let&#8217;s hope that if we were to have the same conversation in 2, 3, 4, 5 years time, it would still be on an upward spike. Let&#8217;s hope that&#8217;s the case. Jamie, thank you for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:02] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Thanks very much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/JamieMarsland/videos\">Jamie Marsland</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie has a varied background in technical corporate leadership, and has been guiding Pootlepress for over a decade. Initially a training service, <a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/\">Pootlepress</a> has become a product-focused company known for its WordPress plugins. Jamie&#8217;s depth of experience in the industry is increasingly overshadowed by his visibility as a YouTuber, where, as you’ll hear, much of his attention is now focussed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode we cover some new ground. We talk about a critical issue facing WordPress today, the fierce competition from platforms like Canva and Wix, and the marketing hurdles that WordPress must navigate to maintain its market share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also explore Jamie&#8217;s unconventional path to becoming a content creator, discussing how he went from teaching tennis to teaching tech, and how he&#8217;s leveraged YouTube to grow his audience and business. His perspective is that it’s important to make technical concepts accessible and easy to understand. Making his content is a lot of work, most of which happens behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into this a little more deeply and Jamie shares his strategies for effective video creation, from planning to execution, along with his thoughts on sponsored content and its place in the YouTube ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about the future of WordPress, content creation, or the dynamics of digital learning, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/\">Pootlepress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/caxton/\">Caxton</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/state-of-the-word/\">State of the Word 2023</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/JamieMarsland/videos\">Jamie&#8217;s YouTube channel</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/session/the-future-of-wordpress/\">Noel Tock at WordCamp Asia</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/98-marieke-van-de-rakt-on-uniting-the-wordpress-community-for-a-stronger-future\">Marieke van de Rakt on Uniting the WordPress Community for a Stronger Future</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/the-future-is-open-source/\">The future is open-source</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/canva-create/\">Canva Create</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: reCAPTCHA V2 vs V3: Key Differences (And the Best Alternative)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=283843\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"https://akismet.com/blog/recaptcha-v2-vs-v3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22764:\"<p>Every website needs spam protection. If you’re part of an enterprise&#8209;level team, you know the shocking number of resources companies actually have to devote to this. Without some kind of software that helps filter out spam and bot activity, teams might spend more time dealing with fake activity than real&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/\">reCAPTCHA</a> is one of the most popular options for organizations that want to protect their websites from spam. It’s relatively easy to implement on most websites — you just need to know which version is best for your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>However, it can disrupt the user experience and provide less&#8209;than&#8209;perfect results. That’s why anti&#8209;spam solutions like <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet</a> (which works completely in the background with AI technology) are quickly becoming the preferred option for organizations looking to streamline the UX and maximize the effectiveness of their online presence. We’ll discuss that option a bit&nbsp;later.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this guide, we’ll introduce you to reCAPTCHA and help you pick the right version for your organization’s needs. We’ll also show you to Akismet, the best reCAPTCHA alternative on the market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283843\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h2>\n\n<p>You’re probably familiar with a CAPTCHA, even if you don’t know it by name. CAPTCHA stands for ‘Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans&nbsp;Apart’.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1102\" height=\"408\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image.png\" alt=\"reCAPTCHA homepage with information about the tool\" class=\"wp-image-283844\" />\n\n\n<p>That name is a mouthful, but it describes precisely what a CAPTCHA does. It’s a system you can implement <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-add-wordpress-contact-form/\">alongside forms</a> to ensure that only humans can use them. Created at the turn of the 21st century, a basic CAPTCHA simply distorted letters and asked the user to identify them. The technology has continued to evolve over the years and is now known as reCAPTCHA. That’s what we’re looking at today. Google purchased this technology in 2009 and continually works to improve upon it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As a website admin, if there’s a submission that can’t pass a reCAPTCHA test, then you may be dealing with a&nbsp;bot.</p>\n\n\n<p>Or a human.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, as reCAPTCHA has evolved to stay ahead of the ever&#8209;increasing sophistication of bots, the tests have become so complicated that, in many cases, real humans are prevented from using&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the potential drawbacks, systems like this are essential in today’s digital landscape. Any popular website deals with huge numbers of spam attacks, including unwelcome comments, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/forum-spam/\">fake registrations</a>, and login&nbsp;attempts.</p>\n\n<p>Quality reCAPTCHA systems are capable of filtering out many bot submissions. You’ll still need to deal with spam, but in much smaller&nbsp;numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Though not originally invented by the organization, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reCAPTCHA</a> is now a free service (with some limitations for enterprises) that Google provides, and that you can implement for any website or web application. You even get to choose between different versions, depending on the type of protection you want to&nbsp;implement.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1274\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-1.png\" alt=\"reCAPTCHA v3 vs reCAPTCHA v2\" class=\"wp-image-283846\" />\n\n\n<p>These versions offer very different experiences and reCAPTCHA implementations. In the next section, we’ll explore what those differences are, and discuss the evolution from the first version of reCAPTCHA to the current&nbsp;model.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The evolution of reCAPTCHA from V1 to&nbsp;V3</h2>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA has evolved fairly dramatically since its inception. The changes in how the reCAPTCHA system works reflect new developments in the technology used to combat bots and spam. Let’s take a look at the three major&nbsp;versions.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA V1</h3>\n\n\n<p>The first version of reCAPTCHA launched in 2007, and it displayed images with distorted textual characters. You can still see this type of CAPTCHA in many places on the web. You’re unable to copy the text, and the letters are heavily distorted to deter programs that might try to analyze the image’s&nbsp;contents.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"760\" height=\"294\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-2.png\" alt=\"CAPTCHA with instructions on entering two words\" class=\"wp-image-283847\" />\n\n\n<p>This type of CAPTCHA also fulfilled a secondary purpose. A lot of the images of text were taken from digitized books. If you resolved this type of CAPTCHA, you not only proved that you’re human, but you also helped software better recognize the language in digitized&nbsp;books.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, this is the most straightforward type of reCAPTCHA you can implement for your organization. It’s relatively easy for most people to solve (as CAPTCHAs should be). However, it’s also become outdated over&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<p>These days, there’s plenty of software and bots that are sophisticated enough to recognize the letters that images contain. That means reCAPTCHA V1 is no longer an effective&nbsp;option.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA V2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA V2 is where Google stepped in. They acquired the software in 2009 and launched V2 in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>This version of reCAPTCHA offered a <em>very </em>different experience from anything else on the market. Instead of having visitors solve a puzzle to prove they’re human, reCAPTCHA V2 shows a simple checkbox that says, “I am not a&nbsp;robot”.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"948\" height=\"566\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-3.png\" alt=\"reCAPTCHA with a checkbox for I am not a robot\" class=\"wp-image-283848\" />\n\n\n<p>As an end user, all you have to do is click on the checkbox. reCAPTCHA V2 analyzes the user behavior during that process, and only presents further challenges if the system suspects it’s dealing with a&nbsp;bot.</p>\n\n<p>Those subsequent challenges typically involve image recognition tasks. reCAPTCHA V2 might ask you to select all the images that contain a specific element, like vehicles or&nbsp;stairs.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"874\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png\" alt=\"grid of images to review\" class=\"wp-image-283849\" />\n\n\n<p>The goal of these changes was to make CAPTCHAs more user&#8209;friendly. reCAPTCHA V1 is often frustrating for visitors, since it’s easy to mistake some of the characters shown in the&nbsp;images.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, visitors often needed multiple tries to resolve a V1 reCAPTCHA. With V2, some visitors will still need to solve rote verification challenges, but most can just check a box and&nbsp;proceed.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">reCAPTCHA V3</h3>\n\n\n<p>V3 is the latest version of reCAPTCHA and the current industry standard. It launched in 2018, and it offers human verification that works entirely in the background of a&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n<p>With reCAPTCHA V3, visitors don’t need to solve any challenges or tick any verification boxes. The software analyzes user behavior and gives each visitor a score. Depending on the score, it can determine whether a visitor is a human or a&nbsp;bot.</p>\n\n<p>As the administrator, you can lower or raise the threshold for human verification with reCAPTCHA V3. The software gives you control over how strict it is, and whether it should completely block traffic it deems to be from&nbsp;bots.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, reCAPTCHA V3 is better from a user&#8209;experience standpoint. Instead of forcing visitors to interact with a CAPTCHA system or solve random challenges, V3 simply analyzes their behavior behind the scenes. A human visitor may be locked out if they are incorrectly determined to be a bot, but this should be rare (depending on your chosen&nbsp;settings).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding reCAPTCHA&nbsp;V2</h2>\n\n<p>These days, it doesn’t make sense to use reCAPTCHA V1, whether it’s for a small business or an enterprise&#8209;level website. That version of the software is deprecated, which means your choice will be between V2 and V3 (or a completely different&nbsp;alternative).</p>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA V2 aims to minimize the number of visitors who need to solve challenges to prove they’re human. With V2, most visitors will only see a simple checkbox they need to tick to prove that they’re not&nbsp;bots.</p>\n\n<p>This can seem like a rudimentary approach, but it works because V2 also analyzes user behavior in the background. If it sees suspicious activity, it will also ask visitors to resolve visual&nbsp;challenges.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, only a small number of human visitors should be presented with those additional challenges. This can be a safer approach than using a CAPTCHA system that works fully in the background because it provides a second chance for humans falsely labeled as robots. Plus, it doesn’t allow the site admin to reduce the level of strictness, as is the case for&nbsp;V3.</p>\n\n\n<p>The downside of reCAPTCHA V2 is that it will inconvenience visitors in some cases. However, presenting challenges can also help to keep your organization’s website safer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Aside from the occasional annoyance for visitors, versions of reCAPTCHA that rely on visual challenges can present accessibility issues. reCAPTCHA offers audio versions of its challenges for visitors with visual impairments, but the system is not&nbsp;perfect.</p>\n\n\n<p>Google provides support for <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">implementing reCAPTCHA V2</a> on your website using JavaScript. It’s worth noting that while the service is free, it only supports up to one million assessments per month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>If you do require additional assessments, you’ll need to budget for a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/pricing\">reCAPTCHA Enterprise</a>&nbsp;plan.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding reCAPTCHA&nbsp;V3</h2>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA V3 is the latest version of the CAPTCHA software. It does away with human verification challenges, and instead uses a score system that works entirely in the&nbsp;background.</p>\n\n<p>When you implement reCAPTCHA V3 to protect a form, it automatically analyzes the behavior of any user who tries to access it. The software uses an algorithm to determine if a visitor is a human or a bot, by scoring them using specific&nbsp;criteria.</p>\n\n<p>The approach of V3 is completely different from previous versions of the software. You can calibrate the scoring system for your site to decide what is an acceptable threshold for determining ‘human behavior’, and block traffic the system thinks is&nbsp;suspicious.</p>\n\n<p>This version of the software offers the most user&#8209;friendly implementation of CAPTCHA. That’s because visitors don’t need to deal with challenges or interact with any elements to prove that they’re&nbsp;human.</p>\n\n<p>The downside of this approach is that it can lead to more false negatives. No bot detection system is perfect, and without challenges, your organization might end up dealing with more spam&nbsp;submissions.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of integration, you can <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3\">implement reCAPTCHA V3</a> on your website using JavaScript. The code is different from V2, and you get a lot of control over how the implementation works and how sensitive it is when it comes to scoring user&nbsp;behavior.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Choosing between reCAPTCHA V2 and&nbsp;V3</h2>\n\n<p>Any organization with a significant online presence needs some sort of protection against spam and bot activity. reCAPTCHA V2 and V3 are among the most popular options because they’re relatively easy to implement, and they have generous free&nbsp;plans.</p>\n\n<p>Using V3 might seem like the logical option, since it’s the latest version of the reCAPTCHA software. In practice, though, V2 continues to be an incredibly popular version of the&nbsp;software.</p>\n\n<p>Both V2 and V3 provide comprehensive protection from spam for your website, but they do it using two different approaches. Despite being older, V2 offers a more secure experience, since it still implements a challenge system for suspicious&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<p>V3, on the other hand, can be more prone to false positives/negatives. Since you can configure what the software does if it detects suspicious activity, there’s more room for potential human error during the implementation&nbsp;process.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, reCAPTCHA V2 offers a more secure experience that is ideal for sensitive forms. If you have forms dealing with sensitive user data, having the option to present challenges can help you avoid problems like fake ecommerce&nbsp;orders.</p>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA V3 can be incredibly effective, but it prioritizes user experience over higher levels of security. This makes it a better option for less sensitive forms and user submissions, such as comments&nbsp;sections.</p>\n\n<p>You <em>can </em>configure reCAPTCHA V3 to be more strict in detecting bot activity. The downside of this approach is that it can increase the rate of false positives. If you use reCAPTCHA to block bot traffic, and it mistakes a human visitor for a fake one, they’re unlikely to be happy with the&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, there is no single best version of reCAPTCHA. You’ll need to consider the relative strengths and weaknesses of each one to determine which is most appropriate for your website. (There are also alternative tools you can use, which we’ll discuss&nbsp;shortly.)</p>\n\n<p>When it comes time to implement one of these systems, Google provides plenty of useful documentation for both reCAPTCHA V2 and V3. Your organization can set either one up manually, or via plugins if you use a content management system (CMS) like&nbsp;WordPress.</p>\n\n<p>Both versions of reCAPTCHA are free for up to one million validations per&nbsp;month.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exploring the alternatives to&nbsp;reCAPTCHA</h2>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is not the only option at your disposal. If you’re not happy with the approach that either V2 or V3 uses, then it’s smart to consider <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">alternative spam protection solutions</a> for your&nbsp;organization.</p>\n\n<p>While there are a variety of anti&#8209;spam solutions available, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet</a> is the only one that rivals reCAPTCHA in terms of how easy it is to implement <em>and</em> its success rate. With Akismet, you get bot protection with 99.99%&nbsp;accuracy.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1243\" height=\"846\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-5.png\" alt=\"stats about Akismet\'s success\" class=\"wp-image-283850\" />\n\n\n<p>More importantly, Akismet doesn’t rely on challenges to separate humans from bots. It offers a solution that works in the background to protect your website from spam, and it provides a fully free plan for personal websites and&nbsp;blogs.</p>\n\n<p>For professional websites, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">there’s flexible pricing</a>. Small businesses can get the protection they need via the Pro plan for just $9.95 per month (when billed yearly). For <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">enterprise&#8209;level spam protection</a>, organizations can get plans and pricing that’s customized around their specific&nbsp;needs.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The leader in spam&nbsp;protection</h2>\n\n<p>No matter which spam protection solution you choose for your organization, it needs to fulfill two key criteria. The first is to protect you against as much spam and bot activity as possible, with the fewest false positives along the way. The second is to protect a strong user&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<p>The importance of that user experience can’t be discounted. Some CAPTCHA solutions, like reCAPTCHA V2, are aggressive when it comes to presenting challenges after they detect suspicious activity. In some cases, reCAPTCHA V2 can force visitors to solve multiple challenges before giving them the green&nbsp;light.</p>\n\n<p>That aggressive approach to spam detection can keep your website safe. The downside is that it can scare visitors away because solving multiple CAPTCHAs is not an enjoyable&nbsp;experience.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">Akismet solves this problem</a> by providing behind&#8209;the&#8209;scenes detection based on machine learning. It analyzes data from real spam on over 100 million websites to provide the most accurate detection&nbsp;possible.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1126\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-6.png\" alt=\"Aksimet page with the text \" />\n\n\n<p>Akismet provides simple integration with all kinds of websites, and it’s particularly easy to implement if you’re using WordPress. Your website administrator can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">install the Akismet plugin</a>, activate it, and start filtering spam right&nbsp;away.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1097\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-7.png\" alt=\"Akismet plugin listing\" class=\"wp-image-283852\" />\n\n\n<p>Although Akismet filters spam and bot activity in the background, you can also check to make sure it doesn’t flag any real submissions as spam. This is rare, but it sometimes happens, and Akismet learns from these situations to avoid flagging similar activity in the&nbsp;future.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked&nbsp;questions</h2>\n\n<p>If you still have any questions about spam protection and what solutions to consider, this section will aim to answer them. Let’s start by recapping the key elements of&nbsp;reCAPTCHA.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA is a CAPTCHA solution offered by Google. You can choose from reCAPTCHA V2 or V3 for your website, and implement either option using&nbsp;JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Both versions of the software offer unique approaches to how they protect your website from spam. You can use either version for free for up to one million validations per&nbsp;month.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the primary goal of reCAPTCHA in website&nbsp;security?</h3>\n\n<p>The primary goal of reCAPTCHA is to stop spam form submissions. That includes spam comments, brute&#8209;force attacks through login screens, fake payment information, and other types of&nbsp;attacks.</p>\n\n<p>The software does this by helping to distinguish between real interactions on a website and bots. Different versions of reCAPTCHA use unique approaches to achieve this&nbsp;protection.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How have CAPTCHA mechanisms evolved over the years, leading up to reCAPTCHA V2 and&nbsp;V3?</h3>\n\n<p>Over time, CAPTCHA mechanisms have evolved to rely less on challenges and more on behind&#8209;the&#8209;scenes analysis. With reCAPTCHA V1, visitors were forced to solve challenges to prove they were human. Whereas the newest version of the software (V3) analyzes behavior without any input required from&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can bots still bypass reCAPTCHA systems? And if so, how do newer versions mitigate&nbsp;this?</h3>\n\n<p>CAPTCHA systems are always in a race to stay ahead of newer, stronger bots. There’s a community of malicious actors who work to bypass reCAPTCHA protections, as well as other similar systems. This is because <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/spambots-theyre-not-just-like-us-introducing-akismets-newest-spam-fighting-feature/\">spambots</a> and automated attacks can be incredibly lucrative, and there’s significant interest in programs that can bypass well&#8209;known&nbsp;CAPTCHAs.</p>\n\n<p>Newer versions mitigate this risk through continued development. Any CAPTCHA solution you choose needs to get regular updates to both the core software and its spam database, in order to stay ahead of attackers. If the solution you’re using doesn’t do this, it will quickly become&nbsp;outdated.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can I use reCAPTCHA V2 and V3 simultaneously for added&nbsp;security?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, you can use reCAPTCHA V2 and V3 on the same website to protect different pages and assets. Google includes information on how to implement both versions of reCAPTCHA in its developer&nbsp;handbook.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the best alternative to&nbsp;reCAPTCHA?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet offers the best alternative to reCAPTCHA for both small business websites and enterprise&#8209;level projects. You can easily implement Akismet on any type of website, but it’s particularly easy to do so if your organization uses&nbsp;WordPress.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does Akismet’s approach to spam protection differ from traditional CAPTCHA&nbsp;methods?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet uses machine learning to analyze spam from the millions of websites that use it. This gives it access to one of the largest databases in the world for spam and bot activity, which means fewer false&nbsp;positives.</p>\n\n<p>With Akismet, visitors also don’t need to solve challenges to prove they’re human. The software can analyze their submissions and use its training to determine what’s spam and what&nbsp;isn’t.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The most trusted solution for spam&nbsp;protection</h2>\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for the easiest solution to implement with the most accurate results and absolutely zero interference for your visitors, your best choice is Akismet. It’s blocked over 500 billion instances of spam and is used on over 100 million sites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>reCAPTCHA offers some additional customization, but also comes with risks like false positives that lock out real users and an annoying experience that could reduce your conversions. You can integrate Akismet with any system via an open API, or take advantage of its popular, pre&#8209;built plugin for WordPress&nbsp;sites.</p>\n\n\n<p>Many website owners can use Akismet absolutely free. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">Explore Akismet plans</a>.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Do The Woo Community: Leveraging WooCommerce for Wyrmwood Gaming with Douglas Costello\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=81053\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://dothewoo.io/leveraging-woocommerce-for-wyrmwood-gaming-with-douglas-costello/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:123:\"The Woo team and Douglas discuss Wyrmwood\'s journey, Kickstarter success, challenges of growth, and multi-channel commerce.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Apr 2024 09:49:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Donncha: Speculating on what to load next\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://odd.blog/?p=89590546\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://odd.blog/2024/04/10/speculating-on-what-to-load-next/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1974:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/speculation-rules/\">Speculative Loading</a> plugin for WordPress is a plugin you should probably try out on your site, especially if you use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/\">WP Super Cache</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-boost/\">Jetpack Boost</a> to cache things.

Instagram influencers made it a thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we heard you. Your Gravatar profile page has always been a little too cookie-cutter. Now, you can customize it with fresh features that let you stand out online. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Links, Your Order</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-13.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1227\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Rearrange your verified links. Today&#8217;s highlight upfront, tomorrow&#8217;s passion project next. Flexibility, finally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also now hide individual verified accounts, keeping the connection in your Gravatar Profile but not displaying it on your public profile page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To rearrange, click the small button with 3 dots in the <em>Verified Accounts</em> menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Color Your Profile</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-16.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1238\" />\n\n\n\n<p>New background colors and overlays are here. Minimalist? Vibrant? It&#8217;s your call—your Gravatar, your palette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buttons and links also get a color update. They used to always be blue, but now you can match them to your mood, your style, or your brand. It&#8217;s all in your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Unique URL</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-15.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1239\" />\n\n\n\n<p>You may not like the URL for your profile, or you may want something easier to remember and share. Well, now you can edit your URL. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for the Change profile URL link in the bottom left-side menu when editing your profile. Please note that editing your URL will also change your WordPress.com username.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it memorable, make it you. Stand out in the digital crowd and share your URL with the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why These Updates?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is your web-wide passport. We&#8217;re just making it more you. More control, more customization, more ways to express who you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jump into your <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/profile\">Gravatar account</a>.

For each of these to be possible, the person or organization on the other side must be sure that this identity is legit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more than <a href=\"https://www.javelinstrategy.com/2022-Identity-fraud-scams-report\">42 million folks reporting to have been victims of identity fraud just in 2021</a> and just in the USA, everyone must be highly vigilant regarding their digital information. This guide covers why digital identity verification is necessary and the various methods you can use to enable it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also get familiar with a standout solution in digital identity management – <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>. Our platform simplifies digital identity verification and facilitates more seamless integration for developers creating websites, web apps, or digital stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s jump right into it!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is digital identity verification?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, this is the process of <strong>authenticating users to confirm their identity is legitimate</strong>, preventing fraud attempts and elevating cybersecurity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This involves collecting various <em>types </em>of user data – from personal information like name and date of birth to biometric data such as fingerprints or facial patterns. This data is then carefully analyzed, creating a digital identity that the system uses to assess whether the user is genuinely who they claim to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sectors such as cybersecurity, online banking, and eCommerce, digital identity verification is essential. Online banking, for instance, can prevent unauthorized access to private accounts, avoiding substantial financial losses. Similarly, in ecommerce, verifying customer identities can deter fraudulent transactions, leading to a safer shopping environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital fraud has serious real-life consequences. In 2022 alone, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/topics/11020/online-fraud-in-the-united-states/#topicOverview\">cybercrime accounted for monetary losses, amassing an astounding 10.3 billion U.S. dollars</a>, making it evident just how critical digital identity verification is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, with advanced technological strategies, such as multi-factor authentication and AI-powered checks, and by following regulatory mandates such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), you can effectively keep cybercriminals at bay and create a secure digital environment where users can interact fearlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Compliance with Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering regulations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>KYC guidelines require financial businesses to corroborate the identity and suitability of every customer while continuously monitoring their transactions for suspicious activities. Similarly, AML regulations are comprehensive policies designed to combat illicit actions like money laundering or terror financing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can probably guess, to comply with these regulations, you need to apply different digital identity verification methods; for example – Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided digital identity verification. Advanced algorithms can quickly detect anomalies in user profiles, enabling faster, more accurate determination of a user&#8217;s identity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Website security</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing a solid verification process can protect many different website elements from unauthorized access and potential data theft, including user login interfaces, transactional pages, and backend data storage facilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without a secure verification process, websites become easy targets for cybercriminals and are exposed to threats with potentially catastrophic outcomes – from loss of sensitive user information, identity theft, and damaging brand reputation to great financial losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, this can be easily prevented by implementing robust digital identity verification methods and ensuring that all employees and partners know the security protocols. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advantages of automated identity verification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Automated identity verification is a technology-based process that uses algorithms and data analysis to confirm an individual&#8217;s identity without human intervention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at how it can benefit identity verification procedures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Decrease in human errors: </strong>Typically, manual identity checks are prone to oversights, inconsistencies, and delays. Automated verification eliminates these drawbacks by employing superior algorithms and databases that enhance accuracy and reliability. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Improved efficiency: </strong>Automation speeds up identity checks, making it faster for users. For instance, if someone wants to make a big online transaction, automated identity checks would greatly reduce the time it takes to verify whether the customer is legitimate, allowing them to proceed with the transaction while providing a hassle-free experience. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Convenience: </strong>With automated identification, there is no need to go through mountains of documentation or force the customer to be physically present to seal the deal. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Increased security provisions: </strong>Modern-day systems incorporate a range of sophisticated technologies, including AI and biometrics, adding multiple layers of security. For instance, AI algorithms are designed to adapt and evolve to potential threats, while biometric checks like fingerprint or facial recognition provide an endless series of verifications, preventing nearly all attempts at identity spoofing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common methods for digital identity verification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <strong>six primary techniques for digital authentication</strong> that can be combined or used separately:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ID document verification</h3>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-4-edited.png\" alt=\"A diagram showing that OCR can transcribe images, PDFs, and docs into text.\" class=\"wp-image-1157\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Identity Document Verification is used to verify the authenticity of government-issued identification documents such as passports, driver&#8217;s licenses, or voter ID cards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract data from a document&#8217;s text fields. This data is then analyzed and verified against numerous databases and real-time information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use many tools for ID Document Verification, such as <a href=\"https://ekata.com/\">Ekata</a>, <a href=\"https://onfido.com/use-cases/identity-verification/\">Onfido</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.jumio.com/\">Jumio</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biometric verification</h3>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-5-edited.png\" alt=\"Facial and fingerprint recognition.\" class=\"wp-image-1159\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This method gives businesses a very high level of security as it focuses on fingerprint recognition, iris or retina scanning, and face recognition. It uses the unique biological traits of an individual that are hard to forge or steal instead of relying on what a user knows (like a password) or what a user has (like an ID card) for identification. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies like <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a> have implemented face and fingerprint recognition techniques for user identification. Their cultivated databases have proven to be instrumental in enhancing user access management, proving crucial in fields beyond consumer electronics like border control and banking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security aside, privacy considerations around biometric data must be addressed keenly with robust data-protection frameworks to prevent misuse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Liveness detection</h3>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-6-edited.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1161\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Liveness detection is an integral component of the digital identity verification landscape. It refers to the technology that authenticates whether the user engaging with a service or application is indeed a ‘live’ human and not a spam bot or an impersonator, significantly fortifying cybersecurity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology relies on evaluating user interactions for signs of natural human behavior such as eye movement, facial expression changes, and depth perception – traits that bots find challenging to mimic. For example, platforms such as <a href=\"https://www.id.me/\">ID.me</a> and Jumio use methods like optical-based motion analysis to accurately detect living entities and mitigate identity fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA)</h3>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-7-edited.png\" alt=\"A form asking, \'What is your childhood pet\'s name?\'\" class=\"wp-image-1163\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Knowledge-based Authentication (KBA) is an identity verification process that uses private information unique to the user for authentication.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes in two forms:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Static KBA:</strong> Uses pre-set questions like &#8220;What is your mother&#8217;s maiden name?&#8221;.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dynamic KBA: </strong>Revolves around public information, with questions such as &#8220;Which one of these addresses are associated with you?&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, KBA has its vulnerabilities, such as people often choosing very predictable questions and answers. So, it’s no wonder the cybersecurity industry is gradually tilting towards safer alternatives. Biometric authentication and multi-factor authentication are growing trends, offering a more secure way of verifying digital identities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is rel=me?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me\">rel=&#8221;me&#8221; attribute</a> is a way to <strong>indicate that two different web pages are owned or controlled by the same person or entity</strong>. This can be useful for search engines and other services that try to understand the connections between different parts of your online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you have a professional blog and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter (now X)</a> account. To link these two and establish your authority over both, you can use the following code on your website and affirm ownership of both profiles in the digital space.</p>\n\n\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td>&lt;<strong>a</strong> href=&#8221;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/yourTwitterHandle&#8221\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://twitter.com/yourTwitterHandle&#038;#8221</a>; rel=&#8221;me&#8221;&gt;Follow me <strong>on</strong> <strong>Twitter</strong>&lt;/<strong>a</strong>&gt;</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>, for example, leverages rel=me to authenticate <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/\">Mastodon</a> accounts, providing credible proof for the influential role of this tag in elevating the digital identity verification process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Identity providers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Identity Providers (IdPs) are trustworthy platforms that authenticate the identity of a user. After confirming the identity, IdPs grant authorization credentials, such as tokens or digital certificates, enabling users to access a website or application without creating unique logins for every site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite simplifying processes massively, IdPs do not compromise security. They adhere to rigorous security standards like <a href=\"https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/\">OpenID Connect</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/security/cloud-security/what-is-saml/\">Security Assertion Markup Language</a> (SAML) to guarantee protection from unauthorized access.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gravatar: The digital identity verification provider you need</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Verifying the identity of users who sign up to a website/web store/web app can be a complicated task, but you can make this much easier with a trusted provider such as <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar simplifies the process of digital identity verification by assigning globally recognized avatars. These avatars are linked to users&#8217; email addresses, authored posts, comments, and more, reinforcing a robust and unique digital identifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, a user is verified when they prove they own the particular service’s login credentials, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/?lang=en\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>, <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/\">Twitch</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stackoverflow</a>, and many more. The moment an account is added to a profile, it is deemed “verified” and, thereby, securely validated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar profiles are implemented across many platforms, such as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, making every digital journey a consistent and streamlined experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This digital verification system stands out with many impressive features, such as:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Privacy-forward approach: </strong>The complete control over personal data remains with the user. They decide what&#8217;s public and what&#8217;s private, catering to the needs of privacy-conscious netizens.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Easy integration: </strong>Integrate with Gravatar in just a few minutes using the <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/general/hash/\">developer API</a>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimized customer experience:</strong> For instance, new users registering on a blog site would find their Gravatar avatar automatically displayed instead of an impersonal placeholder.

Today, we introduce a new Profile Editor, three new profile fields, and enhanced Privacy settings for all users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-gravatar\">What is Gravatar?<a href=\"https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2023/09/20/introducing-the-all-new-gravatar-plus-whats-next/#what-is-gravatar\"></a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar stands for “Globally Recognized Avatar” and is your digital signature across countless websites. By associating a single avatar image to your email address, Gravatar makes maintaining a consistent online presence simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having gained popularity as a way to display avatars in blog comments, Gravatar has since extended its reach across the web — you&#8217;ll find your Gravatar in Slack, Open&nbsp;AI, Salesforce, and more. In addition to the avatar, you can build a free online profile to share with those you meet, bringing together all your social media and web accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-new-profile-editor\">The New Profile Editor<a href=\"https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2023/09/20/introducing-the-all-new-gravatar-plus-whats-next/#the-new-profile-editor\"></a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We have completely redesigned the Profile Editor, providing an intuitive interface to customize and preview your Gravatar profile. Express yourself by adding a bio, verifying ownership of your social profiles, adding links, and more. The new Profile Editor lets you curate your online persona, making it easier for others to discover and connect with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is faster, works great on mobile devices, and with this update, <strong><em>you can change the URL of your profile page</em></strong> too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Log in at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://gravatar.com\">gravatar.com</a>&nbsp;now to try out the new editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"enhanced-privacy-settings\">Enhanced Privacy Settings<a href=\"https://updateomattic.wordpress.com/2023/09/20/introducing-the-all-new-gravatar-plus-whats-next/#enhanced-privacy-settings\"></a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve added <a href=\"https://support.gravatar.com/profiles/profile-access/\">new privacy settings</a> that when enabled will ensure your profile data is private. We’ve also added new settings for users who want to discourage search engines from crawling and indexing their profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/cleanshot-2023-11-29-at-11.35.51-2402x.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-857\" />\n\n\n\n<p>We believe in transparency and empowering users to fully control their digital profiles. With many of the websites you use, there is confusion about the information being collected, how it is used, and when it is shared with third parties. As more Gravatar features are rolled out, you’ll see how we are flipping that model on its head by offering a transparent and open profile experience that puts you in the driver’s seat of your online identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pronunciation and Contact Fields</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three new fields available in your profile, all of which were popular requests we&#8217;ve received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You asked. We delivered:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A &#8216;<strong>pronunciation</strong>&#8216; field in your About section. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>A &#8216;<strong>contact form</strong>&#8216; field where you can link to a contact form on your website or blog.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A &#8216;<strong>calendar</strong>&#8216; field to link to a public appointment calendar like Calend.ly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re paying close attention, you might notice that the profile image above looks a bit different from what you&#8217;re used to. We&#8217;ll be introducing some design improvements to public profile pages in the next few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got more exciting stuff in the pipeline that we can&#8217;t share just yet, but we&#8217;d love to hear from you.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, design and the future of theming in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WP Tavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL in to most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WP Tavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Tammie Lister. Tammie is a product creator focusing on WordPress. She has a hybrid background across product, design, psychology and development. She contributes to WordPress and is passionate about open source and the community. If you&#8217;ve been in the WordPress space for awhile, Tammie&#8217;s name is likely a familiar one. She&#8217;s an 18 year veteran of the project. A talented designer, developer and a key contributor to the project. Her journey has made her wear a variety of hats in both agency, life and product development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Tammie shares insights that span from the practical, to the philosophical within the open source landscape. We get to hear Tammie&#8217;s perspective on this crucial experimentation phase in WordPress theme development. The balance she seeks between minimalist design and functional complexity, and active roles, including the default theme task force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our discussion takes us into the evolving WordPress editor experience, user roles and interface design. We discussed the future of WordPress UI and UX, touching on visual configurations and how the Gutenberg site editor continues to shape our digital toolkit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those inspired by themes, Tammie reveals her passion for them from preserving the essence of classic themes, to ways that the project might break new ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also introduces us to some of our own projects, such as Composition Themes and discusses her Classic to Block Themes project as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie shares some of the resources that she recommends for both beginners and seasoned developers alike, bringing to light the many pathways that you can now choose to learn about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking over the horizon of collaborative editing and design systems, Tammie&#8217;s excitement for what&#8217;s next is palpable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whether you&#8217;re a developer, a designer or a WordPress aficionado this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WP Tavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note, before we begin, this episode was recorded live at WordCamp Asia. There was quite a lot of background noise to contend with, and I&#8217;ve done my best to make the audio as easy to listen to as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Tammie Lister.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Tammie Lister. Hello Tammie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:44] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Hello. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good. Thank you for joining me today. We are at WordCamp Asia. I actually don&#8217;t know the name of the venue, but we are at WordCamp Asia. And Tammie&#8217;s giving us a presentation during the event. But before she tells us about that, just give us a little bit of a background. Give us your potted biography. Tell us who you are, where you&#8217;ve been, whatever you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Ah, yeah. So my name is Tammie Lister. I have been involved in project, oh, I think 18 years or so now, a little while. I have been pretty much, designer, developer, worn most hats around the project. I&#8217;ve been a full-time contributor, I&#8217;ve worked on phase one of Gutenberg, and I&#8217;ve also worked in agencies. And currently, I am working a kind of hybrid function, working with products, and also doing some sponsored contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve been around the houses, haven&#8217;t you, basically? You&#8217;ve been there, done that. What&#8217;s your talk about? It&#8217;s called The Elements of WordPress, but I&#8217;ve got it written down in front of me, so I know what it&#8217;s about. But you want to, just for the sake of the audience, maybe somebody listening to this will be able to watch it on WordPress TV. Tell us what you&#8217;re intending to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:48] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Yeah. So my talk is specifically looking at the elements of WordPress, going up from blocks, to patterns, to template parts, to templates, and then styling. And looking at how they all come together. So everything on the front end of the site, but also the hidden design system as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that&#8217;s the talk. You haven&#8217;t done it yet, have you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:06] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You have. And how did it go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:08] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> It went really well. I was really pleased to be able to deliver it and, as of all these talks, I think it&#8217;s a good idea to kind of deliver it. I always like writing blog posts, so I&#8217;m hoping to write a blog post about it, and then iterate on it. And some of the conversations are really interesting afterwards as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. A little bit off piste, but how do you manage the nerves for things like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I am atrocious with nerves. I am not one of those people that ever doesn&#8217;t have nerves. I would probably worry if I didn&#8217;t have nerves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s something that I couldn&#8217;t do, so bravo. Thank you for doing that. So I&#8217;ve got a list of questions here, and I&#8217;ll go through them, and we&#8217;ll tackle them one at a time. So my first question to you, and because I know of the history that you&#8217;ve had, this question seems like on message, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written down, over the last 10 years let&#8217;s say, WordPress, well, let&#8217;s maybe go for 5 years. WordPress has changed a lot. Tell us what you make of everything that&#8217;s happened since your involvement, you know, phase one, and all of that. What sticks out as the most important moments?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:02] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> The word at the moment that I&#8217;m focusing on is patterns. I love patterns because they, and I kind of said this in my talk, because when people think of a site, they don&#8217;t think of blocks, they think of patterns. If you shut your eyes and you think of a site. So that, to me, is really significant because it&#8217;s starting to deal with the science and deal with the interface as people see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the work that we&#8217;ve done, is dealing with it as people see it, because a lot of phase one, and a lot of all that work was foundational. I kind of use the term iceberg. And it was all that kind of groundwork, or that big foundational pieces. And you don&#8217;t see that, and you don&#8217;t recognise that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work now is refinements on top of that, and it can seem bigger, but it&#8217;s making all of that hidden work visible. So I really like that. I like it when something that I made is changed, I get great delight in that. I like it when the language is firmed, both visually and also that we start having solid names for things, and the name stick, rather than the names changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ve had a a lot of changing of names, haven&#8217;t we?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:05] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Yeah. I really like that we are using proper things, so we&#8217;ll get examples, reusable blocks, and then patterns, and syncing, and all those kind of things. That we&#8217;re also making things in response to how they&#8217;re being used, is really important as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, you&#8217;re going to make the best bet that you can be. So phase one was very much a, well, we know we need the editor, we know we need this, the block kind of needs it, this is how an editor kind of should work, rough bet, you know, throw something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then you only know when people are using it how to refine it. And then, even more so when site editor, the site editor and block editor are very different. So all of that kind of information refines and changes it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned an iceberg, and whilst I don&#8217;t want to sort of open up Pandora&#8217;s box a little bit, how well do you feel the whole of the Gutenberg project, from phase one, was communicated? Because it feels, right now, 2024, it feels like a lot of things are beginning to land, and are beginning to be understood. I&#8217;ve got the intuition that, for the last five years or so there was, just maybe the communication wasn&#8217;t what it could have been, or something like that. So it was difficult for people to understand, and that leads to all sorts of interesting conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I think communication is a conversation, and conversations need to happen between two, both ways. That&#8217;s where I come back to. I think everyone has learned in this, you know, we didn&#8217;t even really have a concept of developer relations. You know, we were asking the people who were building it to do developer relations, who weren&#8217;t doing developer relations, who didn&#8217;t know how to do developer relations, right? Or we were asking people to build it, whilst also advocating for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, all these kind of different things. And we&#8217;ve learned over time, and how to do an awful lot in this project. And we&#8217;ve had to learn a lot of, we have things like hallway hangouts, now and we have all these amazing, like the developer blog, and we have all these amazing resources that we didn&#8217;t have in phase one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had, just had some like user feedback sessions, and we didn&#8217;t have the FSE program, the outreach. That kind of didn&#8217;t happen, that started happening later. We didn&#8217;t have specific people who were specifically focused on things. That was the people who were building it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we&#8217;ve learned from having those conversations and refining it. But also, it&#8217;s really hard to communicate what you don&#8217;t know yet, whilst you are learning how to do it. So if you&#8217;re like, I need to experiment and I need to explore this thing, but you need to give me time to experiment and explore this thing, that&#8217;s a completely different conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I was having, a chat with somebody yesterday, and sort of explaining that if WordPress was a, I don&#8217;t know, a blue chip company, and it was a for-profit entity, and you had a hierarchy with the CEO at the top, you could communicate everything down with just a memo. But the nature of the WordPress project, given that there&#8217;s loads of volunteer hours, and contributor hours, and people are in different time zones, I think that&#8217;s a really difficult thing to manage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:51] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Well you couldn&#8217;t say like, hey, can everyone just go into experimentation mode for like four years, and just everyone not judge anything that&#8217;s going to be produced. That&#8217;s a whole different conversation. And then who&#8217;s going to get the memo that we&#8217;re actually all in experimentation. And then if Bob in the corner, and then Mary in the other corner doesn&#8217;t get that memo, they&#8217;re going to be judging something. Bob and Mary are super awesome people, but they&#8217;re not going to have that knowledge to make those judgements on different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I have no intuition as to whether anything&#8217;s changed in the background, but it sounds, from everything that you&#8217;ve said and the messaging that I&#8217;m receiving, that that message has been understood, in the places where it needs to be understood. That getting the message out, getting buy-in from people who are using it, communicating it, setting up things like the FSE program as you mentioned, and the Learn WordPress, and the mentor sponsorship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:37] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> It&#8217;s maturing of the project as well, and maturing of concepts and learning, like we all learn. I think that&#8217;s one of the things in the open source projects, you learn by doing. And it&#8217;s as safe a place as you can have as any to learn from, and as gentle a place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we all need to be very gentle with allowing that learning, and just give that consideration of, we&#8217;re all learning together, we&#8217;re all reflecting on what we do. That ability to experiment, if we can kind of replicate that and keep that, I think that&#8217;s going to serve us well in the future as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I haven&#8217;t been in the WordPress ecosystem since day one, probably more like 12 years or something like that. So long enough to know a bit, but not long enough to know everything. But it does feel like when phase one began, that was probably the moment where WordPress changed beyond all recognition, in a way that it had never done before. So there may was no need to communicate on such a deep level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:33] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I think there&#8217;s always been pivotal changes. They&#8217;ve just sometimes not, if it&#8217;s not impacting your area, impacted so many areas, I think if it impacts your area, it may have impacted a smaller area, so it would&#8217;ve felt huge in that smaller area, to that group of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it impacted so many people, it&#8217;s the editor, right? The editor is where you go to write things. You want to impact a big area of WordPress, impact the editor. It&#8217;s pretty much impacting the heart, right? In a beautiful way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It really is important to think about, there&#8217;s been, you know, from plugins, to themes, to different things. There&#8217;s been so many areas that have had pivotal changes from day one that, I&#8217;m sure different people would have this on this day, and this time. This was this change that shook me, right? And I can think of many little kerfuffles, that kind of people would&#8217;ve felt, or little blips that people felt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we kind of have learned along the way to have those, and learn from those. And each one you learn from, and each one as a community. I think one of the big things to do is think, okay, how do we then progress? How do we then take those learnings? How do we then get better? And I do think we have some strong learnings from this project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I also feel the footprint is important, because back 12 years ago, let&#8217;s just use that number. I don&#8217;t know what the percentage was, but it wasn&#8217;t 43 that this number, this percentage of the internet&#8217;s being used. So obviously the impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:00] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> The footprint and the businesses that are established on it, and the livelihoods, and the families, and the people that depend on it, you know? And the children, and the partners, and there&#8217;s passion, and there&#8217;s the depth and the roots, and the people that have been on it for decades, or whatever. That leaves a lot of change. You know, trying to change things when someone has been very used to something for 15, whatever years, is quite a change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How confusing do you think the editing experience is at the moment? So I&#8217;m in WordPress all the time, I have this subset of things that I need to achieve. And so for me to do that is really straightforward, because I&#8217;ve spent the time to understand the things that I need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if I was somebody brand new coming to WordPress, what&#8217;s your intuition about how finished it is as an editing experience? Do you think we&#8217;ve got a way to go? Are you happy? Of anybody that I&#8217;ve met, you&#8217;ve probably put as much thought into this as anybody. And so I&#8217;m just curious what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:57] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s baked yet, seeing it as a cake, because I think it&#8217;s getting there. One of the things with core is it&#8217;s always going to be the middle ground. And I think we often forget that when we&#8217;re looking at the interface, or we&#8217;re looking at the product, that it&#8217;s the middle that it&#8217;s going for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I would always encourage people to think about how, yes, you can use it out of the box, you can use the middle, but maybe, what do you want to turn on or off? There are options that you can turn, settings as well. I would like to have more configurations to be able to be done, so that you can have less or more, depending on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the big things from an agency perspective, is more control from user locking, and user roles, and user capacities. I&#8217;m also probably a big critic as well. I think those people that have been involved in the project, are probably way more critical than those who are outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always find that interesting. Like, you&#8217;re always going to be more critical of the things that you&#8217;ve ever touched, than anyone else&#8217;s going to be critical. If you know how the cake&#8217;s made, you&#8217;re going to be more critical about the cake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think, for me, I have a personal taste, and then I have a work taste. And so I can share both of those. My personal taste is super minimal, so I would actually like to see, how less distilled can it be. But I also know, for most jobs to be done, that&#8217;s also not going to be the case at all. So I don&#8217;t want to see that to be the default of the interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I maybe want from a design perspective is absolutely not what should be the default case. And that is always the challenge as a creator of interfaces. But I would definitely like to see different types. I would like to see more visual configuration of that. And I would like to see the ability to, just be able to change the experience a lot more, and style it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you feel that the project is heading in the right direction with the UI, the UX that we&#8217;ve got at the moment? Where patterns seem to be taking a bit more of a leading role, and also we&#8217;ve got FSE. I mean, goodness me, we could spend, honestly we could do two hours on FSE. But, is this the direction you want to see it go in? Some like really visual way of just, okay, I want to put that little pattern in that row.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:57] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> So I love using the site editor&#8217;s Dreamweaver. And I go back, like super dates me. But it is right. Like, for me, that&#8217;s how I make themes now. I love Figma, but Figma, I really use, I don&#8217;t know if you know the concept of style tiles, which is basically just like, you pick your colors, you pick your fonts, and then you just make a little tile basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s kind of what I do. And then I put that into a theme json, and then I load it up, using create block theme, the plugin. I always get those words muddled round. And then I go straight into the editor, and then I start mixing stuff around, and I make my patterns, and I do export. So I&#8217;m basically using it like Dreamweaver, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing, because I find it incredibly effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I strongly recommend people do that, because you are then in it and, would you release it like that? No, probably not, because then you don&#8217;t get translatable, all of those things. But I find it a really effective tool, and it&#8217;s become not just a way to do it, it&#8217;s a way to create. It&#8217;s almost like a coding tool that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns being central, I think is way more important. We do put too much emphasis on blocks, because patterns to me are way more important. One of the things I want with patterns is, I want pattern variations. I really would love to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just tell us more about that, because I think that could easily get missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:11] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Yeah, so as we have, you know, we have block styles or pattern styles, maybe we call it. Being able to attach different styling to different patterns that you can change. I don&#8217;t know how that happens, but I think that that would be really nice, to be able to switch that in the interface somehow. No idea how that happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing I would love is easier sharing styling. In fact, I&#8217;ve had a couple of conversations at this WordCamp of people just being like, I just want to port. People are going back to CSS Zen Garden. It&#8217;s got a place in everyone&#8217;s heart, right? And what if, bear with me, I&#8217;ve had more than one person say this to me in the past couple of days. What if you could go on the site, and you could grab a load of code, and no matter what theme you had, you could put it in, and then your site would look like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Neat. Neat. Really neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:59] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> That is kind of what we want. And if it&#8217;s just styling, I mean, it&#8217;s going to be more or less, right? Because of the patterns and everything. But if you are grabbing that and getting the styles, that&#8217;s kind of where we probably should be heading, I think, personally. Very opinions on my own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for me, that&#8217;s true independence of styling. And that&#8217;s what I really want, because I love ephemeral styling. That creative freedom. I think it opens up, not just to developers. It allows front end developers to really polish their fine art. They can boost their skills. They can do even more CSS on top of it, if they want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they can do even more amazing animation. It opens all these things up to more designers to be able to do it without having to know to code. So at both ends, more capable as well. So it doesn&#8217;t limit anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Some of the steps that you mentioned, I don&#8217;t exactly know the level of every listener to this podcast, but some of them will be very technical, and would&#8217;ve understood everything that you&#8217;ve said. But then you may have said something like theme json, and then some people are glazing over and thinking, what? What&#8217;s your intuition as to where being able to create themes and patterns, what level of expertise would you ideally like to see that? Would it be ideal to allow anybody?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:12] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I would literally love you to be able to, you know, the Pattern Directory, or the Museum of Block Art. Maybe we can literal just go, pattern directory. I would love a style directory. Where you could literally go and grab a style, grab it, and then you can put it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So no knowledge required, you just need to be able to just go through the directory, copy and paste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:27] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I would love that. WordPress Zen Garden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, Zen Garden takes me right back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:32] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> WordPress Zengarden. How amazing would that be, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But I guess even that step for some people, I know it seems almost ridiculous on a WordPress podcast, to say even that step might be a of a leap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:41] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> But if you had it in the interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In the interface. Okay, so it&#8217;s not like a separate Zen Garden site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:46] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> The pattern directory is in the interface. So if you had the style interface in there somehow, and you could browse it, and you could be like, I want a whatever. I have this rather peculiar analogy I&#8217;m going to share for theming, which is, at the moment, themeing should be super easy to change. But at the moment, changing a theme is like removing your head, rather than changing your clothes. Changing your jumpers should be easy, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it should just be super simple to change styling. And themes are great and amazing, but they&#8217;re a package, that&#8217;s what they are. And we need to just go back to having that beautiful freedom. And then we can have these creative freedoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Themes to me are, we talk about design. Design and art are very, very different. But art is where meets WordPress in theming, to me. And art is part of my background. And there is potential for us to have some beautiful art in themes again. If we just have that freedom, and we stop themes having to have all this weight in them as well, and be tied down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I get the feeling that an ideal place for you to land with this would be that, most people can do most of what they need to do when they want to style their own website. But there&#8217;s always still going to be an area for a professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:59] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> If you think of it like fashion, is good example. So you can go and have custom fashion, you can go and have high-end, haute couture. You can always go and have custom tailoring. You can go and have all of that. Or you can go to high street, and go get something off the rack. And I think that&#8217;s a really good model for us to kind of think of it as well, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nobody&#8217;s used that on me before. That actually sums it up perfectly. That&#8217;s nice, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:20] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Yeah. And that isn&#8217;t belittling anything. That&#8217;s totally fine, you know. And that still allows us to have theme shops, fashion shops, right? That still allows us to have very functional, you know, we have very functional clothing, we have functional themes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it&#8217;s really important to think about the site works, the site has to do something. Some fashion is very frivolous. Some themes are going to be incredibly frivolous as well. And I actually adore frivolous themes. I don&#8217;t think we have enough of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some are going to have to just be functional, and jobs to be done as well, because absolutely. And some are going to be frameworks, and some are going to be whatevers, you know. But it&#8217;s having those options. You know, you&#8217;re looking at high street, you have the options to be able to wear different clothing as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some people are going to be super dependent on a brand, and super passionate about only wearing that brand as well, you know, all those kind of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you can peel back the curtain a little bit on this, because of your experience inside the project, trying to drive this change. How does it happen? Are there certain people that we should be, you know, if we&#8217;re strongly into themes, and we&#8217;re opinionated about that, and we want to make the change, where do we go? Do we start talking directly to people like you? Are there other people that we need to be banging on the door and saying, this is what we want?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:36] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> So I&#8217;m not a full-time contributor, so I&#8217;m just like anybody else in that sense. I mean, I have the knowledge, I&#8217;ve been in the project, but there&#8217;s many people who&#8217;ve been in the project and have that knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My biggest thing is use the things, start experimenting, start creating if you can. And I&#8217;m well aware, I&#8217;m suggesting that most people have a time machine to do that, because you are trying to do your job as well as you&#8217;re doing that. But if you can, in your projects, start using them. As you start using new things, you&#8217;re going to find bugs, because the universe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you can start reporting those issues, and then you can start saying, these things need to change, when you&#8217;re changing classic themes to block themes, that&#8217;s one of the big things at the moment. So you can help with those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just find the area that you want to help with. Reporting one issue, which is a few minutes, is an incredibly big help. Having one conversation is incredibly helpful. Watching one hallway hangout, which is an hour, is a big help. Watching a video, going to a talk. But then scaling it up, going to a triage session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really finding where you are. Experiment, have a pattern in the Museum of Block Art. Have a pattern in the Pattern Directory. Find where you want to join in. But by using these things, you start to contribute, is the biggest thing, because you start then knowing how they fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To dive in straight away and say, these things should be this way, without having used them in their current state, is a little bit, you might not be knowing how they are utilised. I would also always encourage people to search to see that something&#8217;s not coming up. So if you&#8217;re going to log something as an issue, just have a little quick search, and see whether it&#8217;s coming up to be fixed, before you log it in the GitHub repo. That&#8217;s always a really good kind of tip as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s the channels in Slack, but Slack can also be quite a lot for a lot of people. So just, yeah, just using it, and just figure out where your happy is. But just start experimenting and using is the biggest one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, joining in, we could probably sum it up, couldn&#8217;t we? That&#8217;s nice. Where would you go? There was a nice little segue there, because you were talking about ways to learn, and you mentioned a couple of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, where do you find to be the best places to send somebody who&#8217;s, well, let&#8217;s just say a novice? Let&#8217;s go with that. Where are the online resources, the places to hang out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> So there&#8217;s a couple of different ones. We are very lucky, we have a developer blog now, which is incredible good resources. But all the Hallway Hangouts, amazing to watch back. Learn WordPress is also a really good resource. And between all of those, you&#8217;ve just got your good start then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s quite a few people in between those that start doing. So Ryan has been doing some through develop blog, has also been doing some live streams. So just doing things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with a lot of these things are, maybe a live stream is like an hour watching. That might be quite a lot of time for you. So that&#8217;s why maybe following like a quick little tutorial, that maybe has a GitHub repo that you can do quickly. Again it&#8217;s, how much time have you got?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I find pointing people to the Museum of Block Art&#8217;s quite good, because they can just go there, they can see the code, they can drop it in. And then they can learn, oh, this is what a pattern is. And some of those are quite fun. Or go to the Pattern Directory, and then they can be like, oh okay, well, this is what a pattern is, and this is how it forms. Yeah, so those kind of things as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.tv is also really, really good, because, if you&#8217;ve got some time, type in whatever you want to follow, and just start learning that way. You can learn some really diverse things that way. Following along some State of the Words, the kind of pivotal points, you are going to find out the points of the project that way as well, is a good milestone as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I will make sure that there is a link to everything that Tammie just said. So if you go to wptavern.com/podcast, and you search for Tammie&#8217;s episode and you find it, there will be all of the links in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lets pivot a little bit. It&#8217;s not apropos of themes at all but, what do you think about this current phase that we&#8217;re in of Gutenberg? Which is called phase three. But the highlight item for me, I mean there&#8217;s absolutely loads to be honest, but I&#8217;m just going to talk about collaborative editing. What do you make about that? And especially related to themes and sites more generally, not just the content, but editing collaboratively, just the way the whole site looks, so the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:47] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I think it hasn&#8217;t been worked out yet, how it&#8217;s going to work on the theme. I don&#8217;t know if it means you are creating the theme collaboratively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s to imagine actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:56] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Well, it definitely means you&#8217;re creating, so if you think of the site editor as the builder of the theme, which it kind of is, then technically, if you are creating content, which is the theme, you are creating that collaboratively, so yes. Collaborative editing at enterprise scale is something that happens quite often anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So tools like Figma, you can do all of that collaborative editing is my understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:20] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Yeah. So I&#8217;m very, if I put my design hat on, very used to, in Figma, like comments and, or even like in Google Docs, people are very used to like leaving messages and whatever. So I just think being very aware of those kind of workflows, is kind of interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things we might find is, someone would just set up a template, and it&#8217;d be like, add something here, and something here later. So adding comments to your templates, might be curious and interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A different aspect might be people using different themes in the backend. That kind of comes to mind, from accessibility reasons. That is also something that I&#8217;ve always thought about is, could people want to have different editor experiences depending on their accessibility. Which you might do as well. So collaborative editor experiences, or different editor experiences. Which is slightly a sidetrack of this, but it&#8217;s something to consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But phase three is collaborative editing, and plus, plus, plus. Which also the design system, finally, kind of flow. And that kind of, to me, is more Lego pieces to play with. And that&#8217;s the bit that I am incredibly excited about. Because a lot of the stuff that&#8217;s been hidden, we&#8217;ve had a design system all along. It&#8217;s really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People, when they talk about the work that&#8217;s recently done, they&#8217;re pointing just to like the editor. Yes, but it&#8217;s not going to just be the editor. It&#8217;s going to be coming into the settings, into the admin, and to everything, because it needs to. There&#8217;s areas of WordPress that haven&#8217;t been touched for a very long time. And by bringing these components, and being this unification through, it&#8217;s better user experience. But it&#8217;s one user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, that point of, it&#8217;s a middle road. If it&#8217;s, the way that it&#8217;s being done, means you then will be able to have the same level of customisation, the same level of extensibility, the same level of styling on top of it. So you&#8217;ll be able to then, for your end users, customise it how you want to. So you have that flexibility still, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s fabulous that somebody who&#8217;s been around in the projects as long as you have, and I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had your ups and downs, I&#8217;m sure that, you know, some days it&#8217;s like, oh, WordPress. It sounds like you are very, very, genuinely excited about what&#8217;s coming. That&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:30] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> And I&#8217;m excited about who&#8217;s doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, okay. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:33] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> It&#8217;s exciting the new, I love when you have fresher people have fresher eyes on it. I love when older people have fresh eyes on it as well, and different energy. I love when, as I&#8217;ve mentioned previously, when someone re-does work that I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;m so excited. I&#8217;m like, yes, that&#8217;s gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s exciting to see areas that haven&#8217;t been touched for such a long time. We shouldn&#8217;t have areas that haven&#8217;t been for 10 years, because that&#8217;s how many years. That&#8217;s like dog years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Tell us a little bit about your stuff. We&#8217;ve heard about your relationship with WordPress. Let&#8217;s just get into what you are doing at the minute. I think you said you had four hats or something. Is it four hats?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:11] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Yeah, I go with lots of hats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What are the four hats? What&#8217;s keeping Tammie busy at the minute?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:14] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> So I&#8217;m working on a project called Gildenberg. I&#8217;m working with Luke and Jonathan. What we&#8217;re doing is, we&#8217;re working on a guild of product creators, and we&#8217;re working to support them through that as well. That&#8217;s really exciting. So I&#8217;m doing that a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also creating my own, looking to create my own products. I&#8217;m working out what that means. Spoilers, going to start with theming. I&#8217;m also collaborating with some, doing some agency work as well. And I&#8217;ve been collab&#8217;ing some awesome plugins, doing some classic block based work. Which I actually really enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s something about converting classic themes to block. One, because I&#8217;m learning where the friction points are. I&#8217;m also really lucky to be sponsored by Automattic, to be doing two days a week on the default theme task force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Go on, tell us more about that. That sounds fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:00] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Yeah, I am really excited about that. It&#8217;s 400 odd tickets on the default themes. So the idea is, eventually, it came from the community summit. There&#8217;s actually a post up by Jonathan Desrosiers. Rather than scorch earthing, and removing all the default themes, it&#8217;s what if we actually fixed them? Which is a beautiful and wonderful concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we&#8217;re doing is, we&#8217;re going through each ticket, and we are going to analyse, does it need fixing? Some of those tickets have been sat there for four, five years. They haven&#8217;t had attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re going to look at it, we&#8217;re going to see if it even stands in this time. If it does, great, let&#8217;s ship it, let&#8217;s get that patch in. If it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s got a new patch. If it needs closing, let&#8217;s close it. And then we&#8217;ll able to see the lay of the land, once we don&#8217;t have this amount of tickets. Then we can decide where we go from this, on block based theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Kind of a nice project, that you can see that 400 dropping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:51] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Oh goodness, yeah. We&#8217;ve already done some at contribution day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh nice. Lovely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:55] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> And it is. I got to be part of some of the default themes. You know, one of my first roles within WordPress, you know, I kind of came in through theming. Theming has been a theme throughout my whole history of WordPress, throughout everything. And my heart is strongly there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And default themes, yes, some of them are classic, and we could be like, oh, just forget it. I don&#8217;t believe that. I think it&#8217;s history. It&#8217;s like denying that we have a history, right? And I love block themes. I think they&#8217;re amazing and they&#8217;re fantastic, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that we should forget that we have these themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we should look at how we can bring the essence of those, if we want to bring them. Or we should look at how can we support the people that are still using them and how can we have that respect. So, if someone&#8217;s using 2011, how can we still respect that they&#8217;re using 2011?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:51] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> As well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a lovely project. You very quickly glossed over, there was one there where you are going to be looking at doing your own projects, but you didn&#8217;t dive into that. Maybe it&#8217;s because you haven&#8217;t distilled it quite yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:03] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I haven&#8217;t yet fully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What&#8217;s, the kind of intuition that that you&#8217;re going to tackle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:08] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I really want to start creating my own themes again, that&#8217;s one of the things. And I also want to start exploring maybe some plugins as well. I don&#8217;t have an idea yet, but the idea that I can start. I&#8217;m going to use the word playing, but playing to an end. I have so many ideas, and that&#8217;s awesome, but I need to work out which idea I&#8217;m going to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so maybe we should do this conversation again in 2025, and see where you are?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:34] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> I have a theme site, Composition Themes, and I want to, I want to start making themes that have one purpose and, both that are beautiful, but also that have one purpose for types as well. That&#8217;s where I want to be themeing. But I also really like the idea of doing similar for plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s blocks, but maybe it&#8217;s also companion experience plugins. Going back to that idea of experience. I love the idea of maybe making the experience lesser for the editor or maybe exploring different things around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Okay. 2025 is the date. We&#8217;ll have you back and we&#8217;ll see. What was it again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:08] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Composition Themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Composition Themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:10] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Yeah. I also have Classic to Block Themes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, nice. Okay, we&#8217;ll put both of those in the show notes. Great. Well, Tammie Lister, thank you so much for joining me on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:21] <strong>Tammie Lister:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are very welcome.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://tammielister.com/\">Tammie Lister</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie is a product creator focusing on WordPress. She has a hybrid background across product, design, psychology and development. She contributes to WordPress and is passionate about open source, and the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve been in the WordPress space for a while, Tammie&#8217;s name is likely a familiar one. She&#8217;s an 18-year veteran of the project, a talented designer, developer, and a key contributor to the project. Her journey has made her wear a variety of hats in both agency life and product development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Tammie shares insights that span from the practical to the philosophical within the open-source landscape. We get to hear Tammie&#8217;s perspective on this crucial experimentation phase in WordPress theme development, the balance she seeks between minimalist design and functional complexity, and her active roles, including the default theme task force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our discussion takes us into the evolving WordPress editor experience, user roles, and interface design. We discuss the future of WordPress UI / UX, touching on visual configurations and how the Gutenberg site editor continues to shape our digital toolkit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those inspired by themes, Tammie reveals her passion for them. From preserving the essence of classic themes to ways that the project might break new ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also introduces us to some of her own projects, such as Composition Themes, and discusses her Classic to Block Themes project as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie shares some of the resources that she recommends for both beginners and seasoned developers alike, bringing to light the many pathways that you can now choose to learn about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking over the horizon of collaborative editing and design systems, Tammie&#8217;s excitement for what&#8217;s next is palpable. So, whether you&#8217;re a developer, a designer, or a WordPress aficionado, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCamp Asia</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/\">Create Block Theme plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.csszengarden.com/\">CSS Zen Garden</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">Pattern Directory</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://block-museum.com/\">Museum of Block Art</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/\">Developer blog</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/hallwayhangout/\">Hallway Hangouts</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/state-of-the-word/\">State of the Word from 2024</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://guildenberg.com/\">Gildenberg</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/12/05/proposal-default-theme-task-force-for-2024/\">Jonathan Desrosiers&#8217;

I have my hot coffee on the desk and my compilation of Bob Dylan playing in my ears, but we&#8217;re on the tenth song and I haven&#8217;t written a word yet, in fact, I&#8217;ve written and then deleted many. Do you know what happens? I&#8217;m not a writer, I spend my life in PHP, why should I completely detach from what is my daily routine? Okay, here we go! I&#8217;ll open my code editor, coffee, and Dylan at this hour are constants, let&#8217;s see if the words flow now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading6656_ed8ffe-24 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">My Island</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m Sardinian, I come from an island in the Mediterranean envied for its sea, climate, food, and the warmth of its people. Let&#8217;s talk about an island, and sometimes the sea is a boundary, it&#8217;s a beautiful blue wall that separates you from the rest of the world, often it&#8217;s difficult to feel Italian, let alone European.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My story begins here, with a strong introversion orchestrating my life, a passion for computer science, PHP which had been accompanying me for about 5 years, and some small attempts to overcome my shyness. Not to mention the years of studying English at school, which remained theoretical and never put into practice. To help me overcome shyness, I had started speaking at small events about Free Software, and there had been some small improvements. Meanwhile, I was beginning to get to know a CMS called WordPress, required by several companies; at that time, I didn&#8217;t know what it would give me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had left my small town and moved to Cagliari, the city, on my island and facing the sea. Imagine, in 10 minutes with public transport, I was at the nearest beach, and in 30 minutes, I was at those beaches you see in screensavers. I felt in my place, at least geographically. But sometimes an island doesn&#8217;t offer you much from a work perspective, and remote work wasn&#8217;t yet so widespread. But my move to Cagliari was just a first step, like when you dip your foot in the water to see if it&#8217;s cold, before taking a run and diving in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading6656_06671b-01 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Let&#8217;s change the song, but also the city and life.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I packed my bags, took a flight, and changed regions to pursue a job. I was leaving the place that De Andrè, a famous Italian singer-songwriter, described: &#8220;Life in Sardinia is perhaps the best a man can wish for: twenty-four thousand kilometers of forests, countryside, coasts immersed in a miraculous sea should coincide with what I would recommend to God to give us as Paradise.&#8221; And I arrived in what another famous Italian singer, Ligabue, describes as &#8220;This city is a hell disguised as paradise, where every dream is at risk of burning.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city called me, and now I&#8217;m here. There are proposals, there are opportunities, there are hopes, and there are dreams, all within reach, my reach. The city is ready to give me everything but it needs me, my time, and my hard work. I just had to change, the island had to become a city, shyness must disappear here and change pace. Walking following that frenetic rhythm, which I didn&#8217;t understand, but which was ready to give me more and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you walk fast, in a place you don&#8217;t know, you risk coming across a street you don&#8217;t know and you could find yourself in a situation you never want to relive. You could walk on asphalt, on the sidewalk, or on a lawn, and if you&#8217;re not careful, it&#8217;s easy to stumble upon something, and from a panic attack, it&#8217;s not always easy to get back up, from two, worse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the same period, I found myself on a fairly intense WordPress-based project, and between one check and another, my eye fell on a type of event I didn&#8217;t know, called WordCamp Torino, just over an hour by train from where I was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early wake-up call, coffee, and off to the station, the train departs and slowly the city fades away. I participate in a contributor day and a day of talks. A nice event, I took thousands of notes but experienced only as much as my shyness allowed me to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew that this event was much more beautiful than what I had experienced, so I started paying more and more attention to that part of the site until I found two tickets, Zurich and Verona. I bought the ticket to Verona immediately, but Zurich was two weeks earlier and the choice wasn&#8217;t so easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zurich is part of German-speaking Switzerland, okay that the WordCamp was organized in two languages, but my English had been stagnant for almost 12 years, plus it was a trip to be done alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verona was a great WordCamp, I began to understand how these events work and to meet some members of the city&#8217;s MeetUp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I remember Zurich less and less, it was a beautiful WordCamp, but I learned more things about myself there than about WordPress. I just wonder if there are Swiss people who believe that my surname is &#8220;sorry my English is terrible&#8221;, because when I&#8217;m a bit nervous, I speak faster and to introduce myself I would say &#8220;My name is Matteo sorry my English is terrible, nice to meet you&#8221;. The thing I remember best is that I filled out the application to be a speaker and volunteer during the return trip. Let&#8217;s talk about WordCamp Milano.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-but-it-s-just-a-tool-how-can-it-do-all-this\">But it&#8217;s just a tool, how can it do all this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was preparing my slides, comparing WordPress development with another CMS, starting from the latter. After finishing the first section where I had to talk about WordPress, I had to create a separation slide. Somewhat sarcastically, I wrote &#8220;But we&#8217;re at a WordCamp so let&#8217;s go home!&#8221; Ajo is a word widely used in Sardinia, taking it away from a Sardinian is like preventing a Roman from saying daje, it&#8217;s the equivalent of an English &#8220;let’s go&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t my first time in front of an audience, but I was used to a maximum of 20/30 people. I found myself facing a university class with a lot of people, I was extremely excited and super tense. But at my &#8220;ajo&#8221; moment, amidst some laughter and some smiles, I felt at home again, in my island but at the same time in Milan, what a strange feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s just a CMS, a work tool, how can it do all this? A stupid question if the person asking it has books like &#8220;Just for Fun&#8221; by Linus Torvalds, &#8220;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&#8221; by Eric Steven Raymond, and &#8220;Free Software, Free Society&#8221; by Richard Stallman in their library. So the term &#8220;community&#8221; in those texts was true and WordPress was the best example I could come across.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the span of a few months, I also attended events in Dublin and volunteered in Glasgow, English wasn&#8217;t a limitation for me, just something I had to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glasgow was at the beginning of 2020, the last memory of a WordCamp before a year of closure, a year where there were online events, but the energy was different. A period in which I changed two jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a period halfway between the city and the island until the end of 2021, when I saw &#8220;WordCamp Geneva&#8221;, I proposed to tell my story at WordCamps, how they helped me, but they still do, both with language confidence and shyness. It was accepted and that became both my first talk in English, but also the non-technical one. A talk that involved a higher intimacy never experienced before, which will always remain a source of pride for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From that moment on, WordCamp after WordCamp, each stop began to give me more and more emotions and more and more lessons, especially about myself, but not about who I am, but about what I could and wanted to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From WordCamp Italy where I first became an organizer to Turin and Verona as a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all three, I decided to participate both days, also attending contribution days and gladly joining the polyglots team, a group I have never abandoned.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-to-infinity-and-beyond\">To infinity and beyond</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they announced WordCamp Europe in Turin, the city where it all started, I applied as an organizer, which was accepted. Now I find myself talking to many new people in English almost twice a week. Every time is a challenge to my shyness, but by now I&#8217;ve learned to accept them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I find myself comparing my first and last WordCamp. From a silent Contribution Day to one where I shared my experience, from being an attendee to a speaker with many listeners, from a day in silence to being someone trying to integrate the newcomers, from a person who leaves early to the last person leaving the after-party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But WordPress is just a tool, the end goal is always something else, in my story it&#8217;s not a website but understanding a part of myself and stopping suffocating my true identity and starting to behave in my own way. Making me understand that my island side shouldn&#8217;t be suppressed but valued, it was always me. Like in the code, with oneself too, there are best practices, they are needed to look back and live in harmony with oneself. In my case, WordCamp after WordCamp, I added one more brick to my self-esteem and I understood something more about my shyness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, living the WordPress community, getting to know many different people guided me towards rediscovering myself until I realized that I had never left my island, maybe it was the city&#8217;s fog that made me perceive it as farther away, it had always been here. The sea has never been a limit, now that I know the way, I can cross it whenever I want. My island was me and now I&#8217;ve learned to accept it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;d say I did well to use the dark editor! Let&#8217;s contribute!</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"italian\">Quella volta che sono uscito dalla mia isola</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfetto, ho il mio foglio bianco, gli appunti su quello che devo esprimere e sono pronto a scrivere questo saggio. Ho il mio caffè caldo sulla scrivania e la mia compilation di Bob Dylan alle orecchie, ma siamo alla decima canzone e non ho ancora scritto una parola, anzi, ne ho scritte e poi cancellate tante. Sai che succede? Non sono uno scrittore, passo la mia vita in PHP, perché dovrei estraniarmi completamente da ciò che è la mia quotidianità? Ok, ci sono! Apro il mio editor di codice, il caffè e Dylan a quest&#8217;ora sono una costante, vediamo se ora le parole escono.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-la-mia-isola\">La mia isola</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sono sardo, vengo da un’isola del mediterraneo invidiata per il mare, il clima, il cibo ed il cuore delle persone. Parliamo di un isola, e il mare a volte è un limite, è un bellissimo muro blu che ti separa dal resto del mondo, spesso si ha la difficoltà di sentirsi italiani, figurati europei.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La mia storia inizia qua, con una forte introversione che orchestrava la mia vita, la passione per l&#8217;informatica, il PHP che da circa 5 anni mi accompagnava e qualche piccolo tentativo di superare la mia timidezza. Senza dimenticare gli anni di studio dell&#8217;inglese a scuola, che sono rimasti teorici e mai messi in pratica. Per aiutarmi a sconfiggere la timidezza avevo iniziato a fare lo speaker in piccoli eventi sul Software Libero e qualche piccolo miglioramento c&#8217;era stato. Intanto iniziavo a conoscere un CMS chiamato WordPress richiesto da diverse aziende, in quel periodo non sapevo quello che mi avrebbe dato.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avevo lasciato il mio paesino e trasferito a Cagliari, la città, nella mia isola e davanti al mare. Pensate, in 10 minuti con i mezzi cittadini ero nella spiaggia più vicina e in 30 minuti ero in quelle spiagge che si vedono nei screensaver. Mi sentivo nel mio posto, almeno geograficamente. Ma un&#8217;isola a volte, non ti offre tantissimo da un punto di vista lavorativo e il lavoro da remoto non era ancora così diffuso. Ma il mio trasferimento a Cagliari era solo un primo passo, come quando metti il piede in acqua per sapere se è fredda, prima di prendere la rincorsa e tuffarsi.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cambiamo-canzone-ma-anche-citta-e-vita\">Cambiamo canzone, ma anche città e vita</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Avevo riempito le valigie, preso un volo e cambiato regione per seguire un lavoro. Lasciavo il luogo che De Andrè, un famoso cantautore italiano, descriveva: “La vita in Sardegna è forse la migliore che un uomo possa augurarsi: ventiquattromila chilometri di foreste, di campagne, di coste immerse in un mare miracoloso dovrebbero coincidere con quello che io consiglierei al buon Dio di regalarci come Paradiso” e arrivavo in quella che un altro famoso cantante italiano, Ligabue, descrive come “Questa città è un inferno travestito da paradiso, dove ogni sogno è a rischio di bruciarsi&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>La città mi ha chiamato, ed ora sono qua. Ci sono proposte, ci sono occasioni, ci sono speranze e ci sono sogni e tutte a portata di mano, la mia mano. La città è pronta a darmi tutto ma ha bisogno di me, del mio tempo e del mio duro lavoro. Dovevo solo cambiare, l’isola doveva diventare città, la timidezza deve sparire qua e cambiare passo. Camminare seguendo quel ritmo frenetico, che non capivo, ma che era pronto a darmi sempre di più.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Se cammini veloce, in un posto che non conosci, rischi di imbatterti in una strada che non conosci e potresti trovarti in una situazione che mai vorresti rivivere. Potresti camminare sull’asfalto, sul marciapiede o su un prato, e se non si sta attenti è facile inciampare su qualcosa e da un attacco di panico non sempre è facile rialzarsi, da due peggio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nello stesso periodo mi sono ritrovato su un progetto basato su WordPress abbastanza intenso e tra un controllo e l&#8217;altro mi è caduto l’occhio su una tipologia di evento, che non conoscevo, chiamato WordCamp Torino a poco più di un ora di treno da dove stavo.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sveglia presto, caffè e di corsa in stazione, il treno parte e pian piano la città si allontana. Partecipo ad un giorno di contributor day e ad una giornata di talk. Un bel evento, preso migliaia di appunti ma vissuto come solo la mia timidezza mi permetteva di essere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sapevo che questo evento era molto più bello di quello che avevo vissuto, quindi inizio a prestare sempre più attenzione a quella parte del sito sino a che non trovai due biglietti, Zurigo e Verona. Il biglietto di Verona lo presi subito, ma Zurigo era due settimane prima e la scelta non era così facile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zurigo fa parte della Svizzera tedesca, ok che il WordCamp era organizzato in due lingue, ma il mio inglese era rimasto fermo da quasi 12 anni, in più era un viaggio da fare da solo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verona fu un ottimo WordCamp, iniziai a capire il funzionamento di questi eventi e conoscere alcuni componenti dei MeetUp della città.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zurigo sinceramente lo ricordo sempre meno, è stato un bellissimo WordCamp, ma ho imparato lì più cose su me stesso che su WordPress. Mi chiedo solamente se ci sono svizzeri che credono che il mio cognome sia “sorry my English is terrible”, perchè quando sono un po’ nervoso, parlo più veloce e per presentarmi dicevo “My name is Matteo sorry my English is terrible, nice to meet you”. La cosa che ricordo meglio è che ho compilato la domanda per fare da speaker e volontario durante il viaggio di ritorno.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-parliamo-di-wordcamp-milano\">Parliamo di WordCamp Milano.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ma è solo uno strumento, come può fare tutto questo?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparo le mie slide, confrontavo lo sviluppo su WordPress con un altro CMS, partendo da quest’ultimo. Finito il primo pezzo dovevo parlare di WordPress, dovevo creare una slide di separazione, un po’ sarcasticamente scrissi “Ma siamo in un WordCamp quindi ajo a casa!”. Ajo è una parola molto usata in Sardegna, toglierla a un sardo è come impedire ad un romano di dire daje, è l&#8217;equivalente di un “let’s go” inglese.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Non era la prima volta davanti ad un pubblico, ma ero abituato a un massimo di 20/30 persone, mi trovai davanti una classe universitaria con tantissime persone, ero emozionatissimo e super teso. Ma al mio momento del “ajo”, tra qualche risata e qualche sorriso mi sentii nuovamente a casa, nella mia isola ma allo stesso tempo a Milano, che strana emozione.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ma si tratta di un CMS, uno strumento di lavoro, come può fare tutto questo? Una domanda stupida se chi la fa ha nella sua libreria libri come “Rivoluzionario per caso” di Linus Torvald, “La cattedrale e il bazaar” di Eric Steven Raymond e “software libero, pensiero libero” di Richard Stallman. Quindi il termine “comunità” in quei testi era vero e WordPress era il miglior esempio in cui potevo capitare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nel giro di pochi mesi, partecipai anche a Dublino e feci da volontario a Glasgow, l’inglese non era un mio limite, ma solo qualcosa su cui dovevo lavorare.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glasgow fu ad inizio 2020, l’ultimo ricordo di un WordCamp prima di un anno di chiusura, un anno in cui c&#8217;erano gli eventi online, ma l’energia era diversa. Un periodo in cui cambia due lavori.<br />Fu un periodo a metà tra la città e l’isola fino alla fine del 2021, quando vidi “WordCamp Ginevra”, proposi di raccontare la mia storia nei WordCamp, come mi aiutarono, ma lo fanno tutt’ora, sia con la sicurezza nella lingua che con la timidezza. Fu accettato e quello per me diventò sia il mio primo talk in inglese, ma anche quello non tecnico. Un talk che prevedeva un&#8217;intimità più alta mai sperimentata, che rimarrà per sempre un mio orgoglio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Da quel momento in poi, WordCamp dopo WordCamp, ogni tappa iniziò a regalarmi sempre più emozioni e sempre più lezioni, soprattutto su me stesso, ma non su come sono, ma su quello che potevo e volevo essere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Da WordCamp Italia in cui feci per la prima volta l’organizer a Torino e Verona da speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In tutti e tre decisi di partecipare entrambi i giorni, partecipando anche alle giornate di contribuzione e portandomi con piacere nel team polyglots, gruppo che non ho mai più abbandonato.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-verso-l-infinito-ed-oltre\">Verso l’infinito ed oltre</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Poi annunciarono WordCamp Europe a Torino, la città dove tutto è iniziato, feci domanda come organizer, che fu accettata. Ora mi ritrovo a parlare con tantissime persone nuove in inglese quasi due volte alla settimana. Ogni volta è una sfida alla mia timidezza, ma ormai ho imparato ad accettarle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A volte mi capita di confrontare il mio primo ed ultimo WordCamp. Da un Contribution Day silenzioso ad uno in cui raccontavo la mia esperienza, solo attendee a speaker con tantissimi ascoltatori, da una giornata in silenzio a persona che cercava di far integrare i nuovi, da persona che rientra presto all’ultima persona che esce dall&#8217;after party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ma WordPress è solo uno strumento, il fine è sempre un altro, nella mia storia non è un sito internet ma riuscire a capire una parte di me e smettere di soffocare la mia vera identità ed iniziare a comportarsi a modo mio. Facendomi capire che la mia parte isola non andava soffocata ma valorizzata, ero sempre io. Come nel codice, anche con se stessi, ci sono delle best practice, servono per riguardarsi e vivere in armonia con se stessi. Nel mio caso, WordCamp dopo WordCamp ho messo un mattoncino in più alla mia autostima e ho capito qualcosa in più sulla mia timidezza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alla fine vivere la community di WordPress, conoscere tante persone diverse mi ha guidato verso la riscoperta di me stesso sino ad accorgermi che non avevo mai lasciato la mia isola, forse era la nebbia della città che me la faceva percepire più lontana, era sempre stata qui. Il mare non è mai stato un limite, ora che conosco la strada, posso attraversarlo tutte le volte che voglio. La mia isola ero io e ora ho imparato ad accettarlo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si, direi che ho fatto bene ad usare l’editor scuro! Ajo a contribuire!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-time-i-left-my-island-quella-volta-che-sono-uscito-dalla-mia-isola/\">The Time I Left My Island &#8211; Quella volta che sono uscito dalla mia isola</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 03 Apr 2024 07:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Matteo Enna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 76: A WordPress 6.5 Sneak Peek\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=17158\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/04/episode-76-a-wordpress-6-5-sneak-peek/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40470:\"<p>Join WordPress Executive Director, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, as she offers an exclusive preview of the upcoming WordPress 6.5 release, accompanied by special guest Dave Smith, one of the Editor Tech leads for this release.

Here we go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Dave, I&#8217;m so excited to have you here with us today. Welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:42] <strong>Dave:</strong> Thank you. I&#8217;m really excited to be here. Thank you so much for inviting me on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So before we get much further, how about you tell us a little bit about what you do on the WordPress project? And if I recall correctly, that you have a role on the release squad. So just let us know a bit about what that role is and what that looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Sure. Absolutely. Well, obviously said I&#8217;m Dave Smith. I&#8217;m from England in the United Kingdom, and I am full-time contributor to WordPress. I&#8217;ve focused primarily on the Block Editor during that time. And I&#8217;ve been doing it for about three years now. And fortunately for me, I am sponsored by Automattic, so that allows me to contribute full-time to the project, which is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my history of WordPress goes back a fair way longer than that, and I used to work in agency land, and so I used WordPress for making things for a living before I worked in WordPress if you see what I mean.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I, no, I definitely understand. I also was agency before WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:40] <strong>Dave:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a common origin story, if you see what I mean. And yes, you&#8217;re absolutely right. I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough in this release, WordPress 6.5, to be the Co-editor Tech Lead. Obviously alongside my colleague which is Riad Benguella. Some of you may know him. He is the lead architect of Gutenberg. So yeah, it&#8217;s been fantastic to work alongside him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, excellent. One of these days, I&#8217;m going to get Riad on here. I think I&#8217;ve never had him on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:05] <strong>Dave:</strong> Oh, you should definitely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> He&#8217;s so kind and reasonable. And I was just gonna tell a personal anecdote about Riad, and I don&#8217;t know that it makes any sense, but I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway. I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway. I saw him at an event like right after he came back from his most recent sabbatical, and he was like, it was great being away, but also like, I had forgotten what kind of energy events like this really bring in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he has always struck me as an introvert, but I think maybe he&#8217;s like an outgoing introvert or something. Cause normally, like, introvert introverts are not like, this gives me so much energy. They&#8217;re like, I know that this is important work, and I&#8217;m here. And so that&#8217;s my personal anecdote about Riad, I am, gonna get him on here someday, but be that as it may, we&#8217;re delighted to have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, 6.5 is coming out are you excited, number one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:54] <strong>Dave:</strong> I am very excited. Yeah, it&#8217;s been a long road into this release. As you may know, well, as you do know, it&#8217;s, it was delayed by one week. That was actually, I think was, was a good decision. We&#8217;ve had a lot of work needing to go into the Font Library feature. I&#8217;ve seen a few posts saying there were bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:09] <strong>Dave:</strong> I think mainly it was a decision about where to upload fonts to, which seems quite amazing when you think about it. I was talking to my wife about it the other day, and she said, really, you&#8217;re delaying a release because of where to upload things. But, yeah, this is software that runs a considerable part of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when we make these decisions about where things uploaded, we&#8217;ve got to be really confident that they are the right decisions. And so, yeah, that decision to delay the release has been good. And we&#8217;ve had an opportunity to make sure the release is fully robust and ready to go out. So yeah, I&#8217;m super excited to see it land.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I have some follow up questions about just like, how doing all of that work in public feels. But probably, we should get through the bulk of the sorts of things that people tune into this episode for, so like, let&#8217;s talk about some of the big features that are going into 6.5 so that folks have a sense for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we&#8217;ll take a look at just like things that you&#8217;re excited to get in, things that I&#8217;m excited to get in. And maybe like if there&#8217;s a hidden surprise for users, things that will be really beneficial to users, but they don&#8217;t quite see it yet. We can maybe cover that too, but like, what are the big things going into this release from your perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:17] <strong>Dave:</strong> Sure. There&#8217;s some highlights, I think that the key highlights, and we should probably cover them. So the first one we&#8217;ve already touched on it is the Fonts Library. And this has been brewing for a while now, and it&#8217;s finally come to fruition. And it basically allows you to manage, install, and upload custom fonts for use on your website. And it&#8217;s really, really powerful. It&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s going to really change the way people create themes and create their websites. It is unlocking a lot of power for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And for folks who&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a long time, you have heard me say for, I think, like a year, basically every release podcast where we&#8217;re looking at what&#8217;s coming up. I&#8217;m like, and this time it&#8217;s fonts. I&#8217;m so excited. And so I&#8217;m saying it again this time, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s really happening this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Dave:</strong> It&#8217;s finally here. Yeah, it&#8217;s a great feature. There&#8217;s a lot of work gone into it. It&#8217;s really, really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So much work. We&#8217;ve been working on it for like two or three years. And it&#8217;s at the point where like getting it out in front of people is the only way to figure out where the remaining problems will be. And it is the most scary part of any software release, I assume, the things where you&#8217;re like, this is time for people to tell us how it&#8217;s broken. Please look at it and break it for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:29] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. We&#8217;ve been working on resolving any bugs that we could find, but there&#8217;s always going to be things we haven&#8217;t noticed. So yeah, we can&#8217;t wait for users to get their hands on it. Exactly. Other than fonts, we&#8217;ve also got revisions that are now in place in the Site Editor. And this is more than just undo, redo that people may be already familiar with in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It actually gives you the ability to fully revert your site back to any state that you previously had it. So you could make some changes in the editor. You could completely close down your computer, go away for a week, come back. And you&#8217;ve still got the opportunity to say, &#8220;Ah, do you know what? I don&#8217;t like the way that looks. I&#8217;m just gonna; I&#8217;m gonna roll that back.&#8221; And there&#8217;s a nice UI that shows you what it will affect. And you can even roll back styles, you know, like style changes. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s super, super powerful. And it&#8217;s just something we&#8217;ve been waiting for for such a long time. Just, it&#8217;s fantastic to see it land.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m really excited about this one personally because I have been to so many meetup events with like new users being taught how to do things with WordPress. And invariably, in the last two or three years, the people who are presenting to new users are saying consistently like, &#8220;You can do any experimental thing that you feel like you need to do with your sites because there&#8217;s an undo button. WordPress wouldn&#8217;t let you do things that fully break your site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like there is a lot of trust in our kind of like time machine, roll-it-back kind of implementations. And so I&#8217;m really excited about this one. I think that for all of our new and mid-level users. Who like, have a little bit of fear, but mostly joy around it. Like, this will only increase that and so I&#8217;m super excited for this one to go in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:09] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s really nice. Other than that, the two things I wanted to touch on as well, which is we&#8217;ve got these new views now for key objects in WordPress. So things like pages, patterns, templates, and template parts in the Site Editor. You can now view these in a sort of a table layout or in a grid layout. So it gives you a much easier way to sort them, find them, filter them. And I think it points us forward to the possibilities we&#8217;ve got in the future for the editor sort of taking some parts of WP Admin and making them more accessible without having to leave the Site Editor. And it&#8217;s extremely powerful; you can search in real-time, find things very, very quickly, do all the things you&#8217;re used to from the post listing screen, but all within the Site Editor. And it&#8217;s for these key objects that you use quite a lot of the time. So I think it&#8217;s going to be really, a really great thing for users to get hold of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Is this related to the Data Views work that we&#8217;ve been doing in the first part of the year here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Exactly that exactly. The Data Views work has been a major feed into this, and this is where we see the fruits of all that work coming to the fore for the first time. And I expect to see more of that in future releases as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. For folks who are really, really watching, like, our administrative side of things, you probably are aware that we, I don&#8217;t know, I wouldn&#8217;t say that we paused the phase three roadmap for this, but I do think that we made a clear choice to get this Data Views work done first so that we could, in parallel with phase three, do a bit of work on the WP Admin redesign, the dashboard redesign, which we all know, like, we love this dashboard, but also this dashboard, it needs a sprucing up, it needs a little bit of, of polish and a little bit of 2024 style I was going to say design. I don&#8217;t know if the design folks would love if I just was like, it needs to be modernized that way, but also like it, it does, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, and I mean, you know, we all know that the Site Editor is being used more and more. If you&#8217;ve got a Block theme, you&#8217;re using the Site Editor increasingly, and you&#8217;re spending less and less time sort of going between screens in WP Admin. So it makes sense that, you know, these things are accessible within that one interface of the Site Editor. So, yeah, it&#8217;s only going to be a good thing for users going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I probably should have like a whole episode about Data Views and what it&#8217;s intending to do, what it&#8217;s actually doing, what it&#8217;s going to look like as it goes because that&#8217;s such a big project. And so many things rely on it. And so, note to self and all listeners, that&#8217;s the thing that you should keep an eye out for. We&#8217;re going to get it done. But you said you had a final thing also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;ve got one more which is this is for our users of classic themes. We haven&#8217;t forgotten about you. Basically, we now have support for appearance tools. So in prior releases, the Block themes have got these really cool design tools like ability to set border colors, border radius, link colors, you name it. We&#8217;ve got all these tools, but they haven&#8217;t been always available to classic themes. And classic themes can use the Block Editor; they may not be using the Site Editor in the same way, but they can use the Block Editor. And we&#8217;ve not made those things available in the same way, but there&#8217;s been work going into this release to allow that to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:11] <strong>Dave:</strong> So now you can opt into those if you so wish. And it is an opt-in basis. So none your themes will break out of the box if you&#8217;ve got classic theme or classic site. But it is a powerful tool to those people who are using classic themes, and that&#8217;s completely legitimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And so is the opt in like something that you can do for yourself or something that your developer needs to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:32] <strong>Dave:</strong> You would need to do it in your theme code. So you&#8217;d need to do that with PHP. So, your theme developer, if they choose to update their theme and provide support for these things. Then, they would obviously need to test their theme works with those new tools, make sure it&#8217;s ready, and then they would ship that update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so maybe after 6.5 is released, you may see some themes incrementally adding support. My understanding at the moment is that the core themes, the Block themes, will not automatically add those straight away. I think they need more time to allow them to bed in and more time to get them ready for prime time if you see what I mean, but you know the fact that they&#8217;re there and ready means that the wider theme audience and theme developers can start taking advantage of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Nice, nice. I have been wondering lately, this is only marginally related, but I&#8217;m gonna wonder it out loud anyway. I&#8217;ve been wondering lately if like, our classic themes, our most favorite, our most loved classic themes do need a little bit of help moving into a Block theme future. And I think that this will help. I think, on the one hand this will help, and on the other hand, like, what would it take for us to just say, and you&#8217;re not the theme person I know, but like, what would it take for us to just say, &#8220;These are our top five most favorite, most used, classic themes that we&#8217;ve got in WordPress. Let&#8217;s rebuild it in blocks and just ship the block version of it and help the classic themes users that love the design, love the look, love the features get introduced to this new block territory so that they can see that not only do they have the look, the feel, the features, but also the flexibility that comes with that and a little bit more feeling of safety as they wander around modifying themes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have no fear of any code changes and didn&#8217;t when I started working with WordPress, as opposed to working in WordPress, but I think that that&#8217;s not the way that that works right now. Like there&#8217;s a whole lot of like, I need to get it right-ish with folks who are using our software. And so I just wonder if that will help everybody feel a little more confident in what they&#8217;re doing, knowing they&#8217;re not going to break things because we&#8217;ve built it so you can&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:45] <strong>Dave:</strong> It could do, it could do. And I was just thinking as you were talking, like, do we have any themes that already do that? And, of course, we do have 2021. If you can think back that far into the mists of time, we had 2021 classic, which is that it&#8217;s called 2021, but we also 2021 blocks, which is doing very much what you&#8217;ve just described.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] <strong>Dave:</strong> So we haven&#8217;t pursued that for the new default themes or block themes, but, you know, it might be something to look at for onboarding if there are any of classic themes from the more distant past, you know, maybe some of those could do with a block theme equivalent just to let people on board to that experience and just feel comfortable. Yeah, interesting, interesting. You should definitely talk to the theme people about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;m going to. They&#8217;re going to love it. They&#8217;re going to be like, Yay! Of course! Of course! I don&#8217;t know, actually. I don&#8217;t know if anyone ever loves the things that I suggest, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re not going to get suggested. I have all these ideas, and they got to come out somewhere. Okay. So do you have something that you worked on that&#8217;s not in this big list of features or that you helped people to really shepherd into the release that you think is really cool? Like, maybe it&#8217;s not going to be super visible or something, but like that you&#8217;ve personally felt was like a cool feature, excited for it to get into the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:53] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, there are a couple of things, a couple of things at the top of mind. One of them is user-facing and one of them is more developer-facing features. So, I&#8217;ll start with the developer feature first. And this one is a change to an API. Now, that API is always a slightly intimidating word, I think, but it just means a set of tools, a standardized set of tools that developers can use to do something. And in this case, it&#8217;s the allowed blocks API.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sounds so fun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:21] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I know it&#8217;s riveting, isn&#8217;t it? But trust me, it does come with some benefits. So the Navigation block is a good example. It&#8217;s a block that acts as a container and it&#8217;s got child blocks. Okay. But you can only insert certain blocks. You can insert links, you can insert social icons, you can insert search. But if you want to insert, I don&#8217;t know, an Icon block, for example. You can&#8217;t do that, but you can with WordPress 6.5 because of the change to the allow box API. And what it allows you to do is say, &#8220;I want to additionally allow the following blocks to be inserted as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as a developer, you can hook into this filter and change those blocks. Now, okay, so far, so good. &#8220;What&#8217;s the big deal?&#8221; you might say, well, it&#8217;s open the door, is open the door to some very, very interesting explorations. Some of which I&#8217;ve no doubt that you and your listeners would have already encountered. And one is by a colleague of mine called Nick Diego. And I think it&#8217;s on the WordPress Developer blog right now. I think he&#8217;s done a fantastic inspiration into mega menus in the navigation block. I&#8217;m someone who&#8217;s worked on the Navigation block extensively in the past, and I&#8217;m very aware of how much users want mega menus to be a part of the Navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:30] <strong>Dave:</strong> I was never convinced it was going to be something we were going to do in core, because it requires so many different things. But Nick has actually managed with this allow blocks API and some other tweaks as well to build a mega menu as a plugin for WordPress using the standard Navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s just one example of the utility of this API. But for example, I mentioned that you could add icons to your Navigation block and you can&#8217;t really do that at the moment. It&#8217;s pretty powerful. It&#8217;s kind of hidden away. It&#8217;s in the release notes, but it&#8217;s not massively clear, but it does open some pretty big doors. And I think if you&#8217;re a developer or a theme author, indeed, you should you should definitely be looking into that and see what it enables for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ll put a link to Nick&#8217;s post in the show notes, and we&#8217;ll share it around the social spaces. So like, I hear you saying it&#8217;s buried, it&#8217;s hard to see, it won&#8217;t necessarily be exciting now, but will be exciting later, but like mega menus and sliders, those are the most contested things that people want to put on sites all the time. Like from my agency days, like when I was thinking in the mindset of a strategist, a data person, that&#8217;s what I was doing. Like, I never wanted sliders. I never wanted mega menus because it just implied that we didn&#8217;t have a decision about the sites we were making, like we had not decided the primary purpose, and also it was just hard to track, but it was always literally every single time people are like well if Amazon has it why can&#8217;t we have it? You&#8217;re like, yeah, I know, but they&#8217;re Amazon. They&#8217;re not the same like mega menus sliders. I know that from a project perspective that we&#8217;re like, that should be a theme thing. That should be in theme territory. But I think it makes sense to have in core because so many people want to be able to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And just because like someone like me feels like it&#8217;s not the right call for your business doesn&#8217;t mean that you shouldn&#8217;t be able to make that decision for yourself, you know, I think that&#8217;s a, I think that&#8217;s a great, a great feature to call out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:28] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I completely agree. I can look for my agency days. I can exactly imagine that sort of thing. We have a lot of people, a problem that a lot of people are facing. So it&#8217;s really important that we provide the tools to allow people to do that now. And we can always look at if it&#8217;s valid to include it in core later, then we can look at that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the first one I had. The second one is a little bit more user-facing. I would say it&#8217;s hidden away. But I&#8217;m not 100 percent sure it is. I mean, Josepha, how often do you create links when you&#8217;re working with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like every time that I&#8217;m in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:00] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, exactly. Same here. I do it all the time, right? And a lot of people do. And for a long while, contributors to the editor have been sort of collecting and collating the feedback that&#8217;s come in from people about their frustrations with the built in link interface in the Block Editor. So if you&#8217;re creating a hyperlink to, you know, hyperlink to another page or, you know, you&#8217;re going to link to Nick&#8217;s mega menu article, you&#8217;re going to be doing that a lot, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something that people do when they&#8217;re creating content in WordPress. And so we worked a lot to refine that with a contributor who, who you may know, Rich Tabor. Who&#8217;s also, I think, on the release squad as well. An influencer in the WordPress space as well. He spent a lot of time looking at the UX and myself and a number of other contributors have spent a lot of time in this release refining that. And I think it&#8217;s surprisingly difficult to get right, but I think we&#8217;ve, I think we&#8217;ve made some nice improvements to that will be nice quality of life for people who, to do this sort of content creation quite a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s things like now when you create the link for the first time, it remains open on the initial creation of the link. So that means you can quickly then easily adjust the link. I mean, it seems obvious, doesn&#8217;t it? Yeah, but it&#8217;s not happening. It just used to just automatically close, and the people are like, &#8220;Hey, I wanted to make more adjustments.&nbsp;&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I wasn&#8217;t done yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:10] <strong>Dave:</strong> Exactly. Yeah, exactly. We&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve streamlined the UI. We&#8217;ve removed a lot of clutter, but we&#8217;ve also added some useful tools, like ability to copy a link and remove the link directly from the control itself. And lastly along with lots of other accessibility changes in this release. We have worked a lot on refining the implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is discoverable for, for users of assistive tech because we spent a lot of time talking to core accessibility team and other people, and they were finding it very hard to perceive that the UI was there because of the way that keyboard interactions work and you&#8217;ve got the block toolbar in the way and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We think we&#8217;ve nailed on a really good solution now that works for, not only uses assistive tech, but actually provides benefits for sighted users as well. It&#8217;s kind of difficult to talk about. I mean, I have got a video covering this on my YouTube channel, which kind of shows it in a bit more detail, but we&#8217;re happy it&#8217;s in a much better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:02] <strong>Dave:</strong> And yeah if people have got feedback about it, and when, when 6.5 comes out, we&#8217;re always happy to hear that. And you can go to the WordPress GitHub repository and raise an issue. And one of us will jump on it and see what we can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And we can include a link to that video also. So like, for folks where this sounded intriguing, but they don&#8217;t quite get the concept, like video content all day, let&#8217;s pop it into our show notes. And everybody can take a look at it there. I think that&#8217;s a great idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:28] <strong>Dave:</strong> Great. Yeah, I appreciate that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So final question, maybe, maybe final question, final planned question. Is there anything from a user-facing perspective again that you feel has not really gotten the airtime that it needs so far?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:44] <strong>Dave:</strong> I think there&#8217;s a lot of technical changes that have happened in this release. So it&#8217;s easy to look at those. I mean, we&#8217;ve covered quite a lot of the key ones that will be user-facing in terms of Font Library and Revisions. We&#8217;ve got things that are going to this release that enable things a lot for people to experience in the future, I think, so underlying changes like the Interactivity API becoming public. Now that&#8217;s public, plugin developers can start to make sites much more interactive on the front of the site rather than just in the editor. So I think that once 6.5 has gone in, and people have started to explore the Interactivity API in more detail, we might see more plugins offering sort of interactivity on the fronts of their sites. An example is obviously the lightbox you&#8217;ve got with images in core, but I can; there&#8217;s way more stuff that you can do with that. So we&#8217;re going to see more of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:28] <strong>Dave:</strong> We&#8217;ve got Block Hooks that have landed in 6.5, and this is going to open for things like ecommerce plugins and to be able to add, you know, cart blocks or log in, log out blocks to things like navigation, for example, or you might want a ability to like all your comments, and you can do that with Block Hooks and then a plugin developer can just, you know, when the plugin is enabled, they can just make it so that those things just appear on your site, but you still got control over the design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot of like hidden things I think are going to uncover new features for users over time as a result of the community getting involved and changing their plugins and themes to do these take advantage of these new tools.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, so the Interactivity API, obviously it has &#8220;API&#8221; on it. And so no one&#8217;s thinking, well, this is a user-facing thing. And while the API is not a user facing thing, like, I think that you&#8217;re right. That what it enables absolutely is going to be really useful and hopefully really engaging for like end-to-end users, like the users that are not listening to this podcast and they don&#8217;t know we exist, like they don&#8217;t know that WordPress has a community building it, they&#8217;re just like, it exists, there&#8217;s a software that came out of nowhere, like, I&#8217;m really excited to see how our developers in the community start to use that in their plugins and themes and get that out to end users. I&#8217;m really, really excited to see how creative they get with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you have a final thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:51] <strong>Dave:</strong> There&#8217;s a lot of design changes, I think. I mean, we can&#8217;t cover them all, obviously, in verbal form in this podcast, but some things that are just standing out to me if we look at the source of truth for, for WordPress 6.5, it is, it is big. There&#8217;s a lot in this release. But there&#8217;s some very cool things for, I don&#8217;t know, quality. I like to see them as like quality of life design design changes. Things like, if you drop an image, as a background image of a cover block, it automatically sets the overlay color for that cover block to match the most prominent color of the background image. Like things like that, they seem small, but over time, they just, you just drop that thing, and it just does it. And it&#8217;s like, this is nice. And it feels like a nice tool to use that just is intuitive. And I think there&#8217;s, we&#8217;ll see a lot of those things landing in this release that can just make the experience of working with WordPress and working in the Site Editor much, much nicer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I remember when I first ran into that particular thing, it was on the Showcase, our most recent redesign of it. We&#8217;re using that functionality in there before it was available in core. Obviously, I know, but it was really fascinating. I&#8217;m not great with color combinations. Like, I don&#8217;t have a sense for, like, oh, that&#8217;s the primary thing. That&#8217;s not. And so having that being done kind of automatically so that my stuff looks good anyway, despite what my color sense said to do or not. I thought it was great. Makes you look good as somebody who&#8217;s running a business. You don&#8217;t have to know how things work in order to have excellently functional, really beautiful things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I think that&#8217;s a great thing about all of our releases. Obviously, everything is supposed to work that way, but like this one has a lot of really cool things like that available. I think those are really the questions that I had. Is there anything you want to make sure to share before we kind of give last thoughts and head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:39] <strong>Dave:</strong> Yeah, I was, I was thinking a lot about, you know, the community we&#8217;ve got with WordPress, and I think that people outside of WordPress may not really understand that how amazing this community is that we&#8217;ve got here, but I wanted to say to people like don&#8217;t shy away from contributing to WordPress. I get that, you know, people like myself are fortunate enough to be sponsored to do it. But there&#8217;s always something that people can do, even if that&#8217;s just spending like 30 minutes testing a release or donating some of your time to run one of the meetings. It can really make a difference overall. Even just filing a bug report for something you see in WordPress 6.5 or testing 6.5 before it goes out, those little things do make a big difference. And if you&#8217;re not sure where to go, then we can signpost you with links, no doubt in this, in the podcast description with where where&#8217;s to go. But yeah, I just want to encourage people to get involved, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. And it&#8217;s all working out in public, like we&#8217;ve got developers, designers, marketing folks, community folks like all doing this work out where everybody can see it. And so that, I know, can look really kind of overwhelming. But I want to just highlight, like, you don&#8217;t have to know everything about what&#8217;s happening in the project in order to get involved in the project. Like every small bit of contribution toward like finding a new bug or confirming that a bug happens across other devices, other setups, things like that, like those all help make things better and keep things moving as quickly as we are able to make them move. And so, yeah, I&#8217;ll second that every little thing that you think like that won&#8217;t make a difference. It does. We can&#8217;t tell that things are broken or things are working or things are in need of some care unless you highlight those for us. And this is the best way to do it is to show up and give 30 minutes to send out a group testing invite to your meetup group or whatever it is that you all have been thinking you should do, like, this is your sign. You can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:34] <strong>Dave:</strong> Everyone should get involved if they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:37] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I agree. I agree. Dave, this has been such an excellent conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:42] <strong>Dave:</strong> Oh, thank you very much. It&#8217;s a pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:43] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> What an interesting release we&#8217;ve got coming out this week. I&#8217;m so glad you all made it this far in the pod, and now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First up, following up on the WordPress meetup reactivation project that we had in 2022, we aim to revive some meetup groups in big cities that are inactive or help the local WordPress community that are not yet part of our meetup chapter program to join our program. There is a post out on the community P2 on the community site. That is titled Asia Meetup Revival Project 2024. I&#8217;ll leave a link to that in the show notes if you want to read more about that and figure out how to get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of getting involved, we have roughly a million meetings. Because it&#8217;s a new month, we&#8217;re in April now. New month, new opportunities. There are a lot of things happening in April. We will be coming out of a major release, obviously, and so there will be some minor release follow up to do. There will be a lot of discussion about what&#8217;s coming next, what&#8217;s in trunk, what&#8217;s not in trunk. But also a lot of work being done around our next big major events, our next big major training initiatives. There&#8217;s just so much happening. Spring is a time when we are looking at stuff that&#8217;s new, what we want to invest in, what we want to grow. And so if you have not attended one in a while or even at all if you&#8217;ve never attended a meeting in the community, then this is a great time to start and join your fellow community members trying to make WordPress better every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing on our small list of big things is I am looking at helping to shift the focus of our WordPress marketing community. We&#8217;ve had a bit of a struggle over the years to figure out what our primary focus and our primary impact can be. So there&#8217;s a post up called &#8216;Making a WordPress Media Corps&#8217;. It&#8217;s gotten quite a bit of attention, and I do really think that it has a lot of potential for solving some of the issues that we have and kind of getting some quick wins into our recent history of that team so that we can move forward confidently together. So pop on over, give it a read, share your thoughts. And if you are one of these qualified media partners, also let us know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. And if you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser, or if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.

An award-winning artist and storied jazz educator known for transcending genre, Regina’s technical foundations in classical music and deep understanding of jazz have earned her the reputation of boldly going beyond what’s possible with the violin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let the stunning twists and subtle turns of <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DZ06evO1WEiVo?si=534335c984804713\">Regina’s genre-bending sound</a> surprise you as you explore everything 6.5 offers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest version of WordPress puts more power into the details. It offers new and improved ways to fine-tune and enhance your site-building experience, letting you take control in ways that make it your own. You’ll find new ways to manage your site’s typography, more comprehensive revisions available in more places, and a collection of Site Editor updates paired with impressive performance gains to help you get things done smoother and faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Regina&#8221; also marks the introduction of some breakthrough developer tools that will start transforming how you use and extend blocks to craft engaging experiences. The Interactivity API opens up a world of creative front-end possibilities, while the Block Bindings API makes dynamic connections between blocks and data seamless. These, among other developer-focused improvements and updates, are ready to help you evolve how you build with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">Download WordPress 6.5 &#8220;Regina&#8221;</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s inside 6.5</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add and manage fonts across your site</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Font Library puts you in control of an essential piece of your site’s design—typography—without coding or extra steps. Effortlessly install, remove, and activate local and Google Fonts across your site for any Block theme. The ability to include custom typography collections gives site creators and publishers more options when it comes to styling content.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"656\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/04/Font-Manager-2.png?resize=1024%2C656&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17167\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get more from your revisions—including revisions for templates and template parts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Work through creative projects with a more comprehensive picture of what’s been done—and what you can fall back on.

Data views for pages, templates, patterns, and template parts let you see data in a table or grid view, with the option to toggle fields and make bulk changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"656\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/04/Data-Views-1.png?resize=1024%2C656&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17165\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Smoother drag-and-drop</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Feel the difference when you move things around, with helpful visual cues like displaced items in List View or frictionless dragging to anywhere in your workspace—from beginning to end.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"656\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/04/drag-and-drop-1.png?resize=1024%2C656&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17170\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Improved link controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Create and manage links easily with a more intuitive link-building experience, like a streamlined UI and a shortcut for copying links.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"656\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/04/link-controls-1.png?resize=1024%2C656&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17171\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s fresh for developers in 6.5</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bring interactions to blocks with the Interactivity API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/04/interactivity-api-dev-note/\">Interactivity API</a> offers developers a standardized method for building interactive front-end experiences with blocks. It simplifies the process, with fewer dependencies on external tooling, while maintaining optimal performance. Use it to create memorable user experiences, like fetching search results instantly or letting visitors interact with content in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connect blocks to custom fields or other dynamic content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Link core block attributes to custom fields and use the value of custom fields without creating custom blocks. Powered by the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/06/new-feature-the-block-bindings-api/\">Block Bindings API</a>, developers can extend this capability further to connect blocks to any dynamic content—even beyond custom fields. If there’s data stored elsewhere, easily point blocks to that new source with only a few lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add appearance tools to Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Give designers and creators using Classic themes access to an upgraded design experience. Opt in to support for spacing, border, typography, and color options, even without using theme.json. Once support is enabled, more tools will be automatically added as they become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Explore improvements to the plugin experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s now an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/05/introducing-plugin-dependencies-in-wordpress-6-5/\">easier way to manage plugin dependencies</a>. Plugin authors can supply a new <code>Requires Plugins</code> header with a comma-separated list of required plugin slugs, presenting users with links to install and activate those plugins first.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From fast to faster: Performance updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes 110+ performance updates, resulting in an impressive increase in speed and efficiency across the Post Editor and Site Editor. Loading is over two times faster than in 6.4, with input processing speed up to five times faster than the previous release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Translated sites see up to 25% improvement in load time for this release courtesy of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/27/i18n-improvements-6-5-performant-translations/\">Performant Translations</a>.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordPress 6.5 briefly, Gutenberg 18.0, the community mentorship program, and some other things that are in the works. And I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time Core contributor for the WordPress open-source project sponsored by Automattic&#8217;s Five for the Future Program. That is a mouthful, and we&#8217;re going to repeat it again. I am thrilled to have with me Maggie Cabrera, also Core contributor, also sponsored by Automattic. She was also the co-lead for the Twenty Twenty Four theme development, and she does so much more in the community as well, and we will talk about those things. Thank you for joining me on the show, Maggie. Welcome. How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Hi. Thanks for having me. I&#8217;m doing really good. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I&#8217;m good, I&#8217;m good. I&#8217;m excited. Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of Easter weekend, and we get a few additional days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yeah, short week. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Short week, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: I&#8217;m really excited to be here with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So we have a couple of announcements that we want to kind of let our listeners know, and so one is, although contributors work really hard, the release team decided to delay the release of WordPress 6.5 for a week to get some more bugs fixed that are gravely impacting the user experience, and make the change to the default fonts directory. There was a discussion back and forth, and there was in Core, on the Core blog, you can certainly read up about it. I think the most important information is that it releases on April 2nd, just after the Easter holidays in Europe, so&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. Yeah, I think it wouldn&#8217;t have, the holidays here, it would&#8217;ve been just a two-day release delay, or something like that, but I think it makes sense to take it out a little longer, and make sure that everything&#8217;s ironed out, and the change with the forms directory, it&#8217;s been a constant discussion, but it feels like there&#8217;s a solid decision now, so that it feels like it&#8217;s,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s a solid decision to get a release out, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, it wasn&#8217;t easy, apparently. Yeah, yeah, it wasn&#8217;t a clear solution there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. No, and it&#8217;s kind of architectural versus practical, and all those kinds of different aspects of it, yeah. Would host work with it? How plugin devices work with it, and how users will find it. So I think it&#8217;s a decision, and we will see how it works out when WordPress 6.5 kind of hits your WordPress instance next week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Contributions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few community contributions that I wanted to point out. The developer blog, we had a great publishing two weeks on the developer blog. Sometimes, we barely get one post out a week, but this time, we had two posts per week, so that is really cool, and in a very broad spectrum. So the first one was how to register block variations of PHP, and I think it was one of the most-read posts on that, and what we saw on Twitter was also the comments was, &#8220;Oh, finally, something for PHP developers who are not that comfortable with JavaScript,&#8221; and I&#8217;m glad we kind of, yeah, picked them up as well. Yeah, and another one that was well-received was the pattern design tips and tricks for developers and designers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Oh, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, by Beatriz Fialho.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yes, I love that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. She did an awesome job with the dos and don&#8217;ts, and kind of make it also visually very attractive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yes. I need to link that one to the Community Themes project, because it&#8217;s really relevant, so that&#8217;s really good that I have the link there for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So the Meta team asked me if we could add some of the dos and don&#8217;ts to the pattern directory guidelines as well, because that would probably also change a little bit how people kind of approach it. Well, you mentioned the Community Theme project. Do you want to tell me about it, or our listeners about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Theme Project</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, sure. Absolutely. Yeah, the Community Themes project is this really small thing that it&#8217;s&#8230; I hope it will attract more new contributors to the WordPress project. So, basically, it started after contributing to some of the previous default themes, I think it was Twenty Twenty One or Twenty Twenty Two. It was such a good experience for me to work with the community, and all the contributors, all together on a default thing, that it felt really sad that it only lasted a few months, and after that development was done, everyone went their own ways, and that was it. So I felt shouldn&#8217;t we just keep making blog themes together, and keep this momentum going? And so yeah, we just opened a repo, and started building some community themes that, they are block themes. It&#8217;s like this space where you can get with other contributors with different degrees of experience that can help you build block themes following the best code practices, and learn how to do that together. Now, we are using that project to also onboard new contributors via the mentorship program, which I think you&#8217;re going to talk about in a bit. So the new contributors will join that repo and help build the themes with some other more-seasoned contributors helping them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, so was it Twenty Twenty Two that had the call for style variations?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I think it was Twenty Twenty Three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Twenty Twenty Three? Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And that was the community project that you are kind of working on, where you had about 38 people submitting style variations, and made it into the default theme. So that was really cool, and it was also interesting to see how different designers approach it, yeah, and was it one or two themes that the Community Theme project released?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> So, right now, there&#8217;s two that are already finished, but we&#8217;re working on four more. They&#8217;re still in different degrees of done, but we&#8217;re not in a rush, which is the nice thing, because a default theme has a deadline, but community themes don&#8217;t really, so we just go at the pace of the contributors, and hopefully there will be, like those four, will make it sometime in the future in the directory. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So where can people read up about it? Is a GitHub repo, or a GitHub space, or is a channel?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, it is a GitHub repo under the WordPress namespace. I think there&#8217;s an old post on the Make blog on the themes team, and it&#8217;s also part of the mentorship program. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, we definitely need to bring this out more, and amplify some of that work that you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, whenever I go to WordCamps, and during contributor day, we usually work on that, on the themes table. So if you&#8217;re around in WordCamp EU, I will probably do more of that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Excellent. So yeah, there are some more developer blog posts that I wanted to point out. The next one was drop shadow updates for WordPress 6.5. That kind of covers that drop shadows were only available for buttons, and only through the theme JSON file, so now, they&#8217;re available with a user interface under the Border and Shadows section in the styles, and come with five presets from Core. And you can add through the theme JSON additional ones, and they&#8217;re now available for images and column both, and the button block. Yeah, so those four blocks can now have drop shadows, have support for drop shadows. Yeah, it&#8217;s quite interesting to see how drop shadows make a revival design-wise, because they add a little bit of a dimension to a site, especially. Oh, and well, we talk about it when we cover Gutenberg 18.0 is, it now also came to featured image, but it will not be in 6.5. Yeah, and then Nick Diego published an Exploring the Block Hooks API in WordPress 6.5. You need, really, a big cup of coffee for it when you want to read it. It&#8217;s about 5,000 words, but it has 4 examples, how you can use this API to add blocks to various actions, and various other blocks, and also change content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> More PHP for the PHP lovers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Say it again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> More PHP for the PHP-lovers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s both, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, you need to tell the block what to do. So that&#8217;s probably in JavaScript some more. Yeah. But yeah, that definitely, yeah, and then the last one was just published yesterday is how to use the WordPress React components for plugin pages, and so you can use the components that are pre-configured, pre-designed. You don&#8217;t have to make those decisions, but you can use them to also create your settings pages, your additional pages on the plugins, and it kind of goes into the next phase of things, when admin changes over to a few additional pages and all that, so&#8230;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mentorship Program</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you mentioned it before, the second cohort of the mentorship program is almost finished. It has really taken off. Almost 50 contributors were paired with mentors, and the program ran for six weeks. Mentees came from a lot of different countries, from Spain, from Egypt, from India, from Brazil, Italy. That&#8217;s just what I can kind of, at a first glance, see. So you have been part of it as a mentor, Maggie. So thank you for raising your hand and stepping up to that plate, and so what was your experience in working with a mentee in the whole program?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s been really good. Our particular project has nine people working on building the community themes that I mentioned before. Of those mentees, they all have varying degrees of experience in blog theme development, and I was really happy to see that some of them were designers, which is something that slowly, we&#8217;re moving towards, which I&#8217;m really excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s cool. That designers are going to now do themes. Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. Before, it was just developers, and then we&#8217;re getting more and more designers, because they don&#8217;t really need to actually know any kind of coding skills to do this. So I encourage any designers to join us, if they want to. I had the privilege to meet a few of them during WordCamp Contributor Day on the themes table. We were working on some community themes, along with other contributors that just joined our org, and I think this is the second instance of the mentorship program, which was successful, they did the first time around, and there&#8217;s been way more people this time, all over other teams of the project. I&#8217;m only talking about teams because it&#8217;s the one that I&#8217;m working on, but there&#8217;s a community, there&#8217;s Core, there&#8217;s tests, there&#8217;s documentation. All of the teams, I think, are represented. So everyone&#8217;s welcome. So yeah, I encourage, from here, anyone who&#8217;s interested in being a contributor to join it for the next one, and keep an eye on that. I think it&#8217;s the community Make blog where they are announcing when this mentorship is taking place, and it&#8217;s really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. That will be <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/community\">make.wordpress.org/community</a>. So the program managers are Hari Shanker and Naoko Takano?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And they&#8217;re both very experienced community members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yes, they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and yes, the first cohort was in July last year. It started in July last year. It&#8217;s an experiment, yeah, and, obviously, the feedback was really great in how it all went, both from mentees and mentors. So they were able to expand this. I think they had 75 applicants. So there is an application embedding process for both mentees and mentors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. There&#8217;s also been, this time around, there&#8217;s been a grant for LGBTQ+ people, so some of them are actually sponsored to join the mentorship program, which I hope will happen again. So yeah, I&#8217;m really excited about that, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s one of the many, actually, efforts to bring underrepresented minorities also to the contributor team, and I really love that there is a sponsorship there, because many women, I say, were non-binaries, have so much requests on their times, that apart from having a profession, or a job to do, they&#8217;re also caretakers of their families, their kids, their elderly, and so they are not as free, most of the time, in our society, not as free to take on extra time, and we can&#8217;t change that, but we can help offset some of the financial burdens that are there. All right, so yeah, I&#8217;m glad we talked about the mentorship program there. Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data Liberation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s another initiative out there since the State of the Word in 2023. That was in Madrid. Matt Mullenweg talked about the data liberation, that anybody should be able to take their data and move either into WordPress, from WordPress to another WordPress, or from a third-party system, and the Data Liberation Project Initiative has invited developers and product owners to a hallway hangout, which is an informal discussion, to discuss and brainstorm around that project, and it&#8217;s on April 3rd at 7:00 PM, 1900 UTC, which is 1500 Europe or Germany, and 1900 is 1700. Well, time zones. Yeah, it&#8217;s 1900 UTC. Let&#8217;s do it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> We&#8217;re close to daylight savings, so you just let those people figure it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s going to change on Sunday. So today is the 10th, and it will be on April 3rd. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> For some people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> For some people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> For some people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s okay. Only for some people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Well, if you miss it, because either time zones or daylight savings time, there, likely, will be a recording, and the topics that will become discussions is kind of the challenging of migrating from third-party platforms to WordPress, the good, the bad, and the ugly of exporting WordPress content. So the potential interoperability between block libraries, and page builders, and what work will make data liberation, and who should work on it. So that&#8217;s quite an interesting discussion to have with those people that are interested in the project on April 3rd. Okay, yeah, every time when I was working in an agency, it was always a little bit hard to move people away from hosting that is bad, or from page-builder that was bad, and all of that. So I&#8217;m glad that there is a project now where all the community can put together their scripts, and their ideas, and their work that they have already done, and share it with the rest of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. I know more and more people who want to move out of those walled gardens, and own their own content, so I think that&#8217;s going to be a great initiative, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, the flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> To keep an eye on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. The interoperability is just unmatched there that WordPress has with other systems, and the more a website grows up, the more needs there are, for sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Developer Hours</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of events, this week was a developer hour covering the block hooks API, and Nick Diego, and Ryan, or, no, Justin, went through four examples, Justin Tadlock, four examples of adding a like block to a page, and moving it from the comments to the top, or something like that, and then the Getting Started Guide in the Block Editor Handbook has a example of a copyright block. This developer API event kind of took that, and see what you could do with the block hooks, and get it into a footer, or get it into a template. And then the third example is to add a Back to Top link to a paragraph, or to the next heading, before the next heading, or something like that. Yeah, and then, last, but not least, how to add a login/logout block automatically to the navigation of a site in the template. So, right now, you can&#8217;t use the block hooks API, all the blocks. We should get rid of the name blocks, and just call it hooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, it&#8217;s only for templates; you cannot do it for pages or posts, but that certainly is the next iteration of it. The recording will be linked in the show notes, so you can catch up on it, and they use the developer blog post on the block hooks API as a guide, and how they talked about it. Yeah. The next Developer Block Hour&#8230; God. There&#8217;s an erroneous block added to it, the Developer Block hours. No, it&#8217;s the Developer Hours, and it will take place on April 9th with Damon Cook and Nick Diego, and they will showcase examples on how to use the interactivity API and enhance your block-building experience for you and your users. So save the date, April 9th at 1400 UTC. You&#8217;ll figure out when that is for you, but I will link to register in the show notes, and it&#8217;s a link to meet up, and they do a good job in translating the times to the local times of your browser. All right, that&#8217;s about that, and I think it&#8217;s time that we start with the Gutenberg 18.0 release. Maggie, do you want to be honest and get us into the groove of things?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 18.0</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. The 18.0 Gutenberg plugin release has 206 closed PRs by 59 contributors. It has a record setting of 17 first-time contributors, which is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, amazing. Yeah. The last time, I think, was Gutenberg 13 point-something. Yeah, it was 13, but, normally, we have 4 or 5 first-time contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I&#8217;m thinking that the successful Contributor Day in WordCamp Asia had something to do with it, but it&#8217;s just a theory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, or the mentorship. Maybe the mentorship, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, mentorship, too, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. Everything counts, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Everything counts. Yes, of course. Yeah, every contribution is worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. If you look, you&#8217;ll find, in the release, the result of additional data view works, improvements on feature image in all the blocks, and a ton of bug fixes, and about 35 PRs just for the contribution updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> So let&#8217;s have a look at some of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So DataViews is the prototype for the new admin design. Not a lot of people realize that, but if you&#8217;re in the blog edit and the site editor, the list views that you see there, the list of templates, and the list of pages, and the list of template parts, they&#8217;re all powered by the new data views, and this release brings with the multiple selection of filters. So if you were in a template view, you can say, &#8220;Okay, I want to combine the filter from the author with a theme,&#8221; or something like that. Yeah, or, &#8220;In a page, I want the ones that are published and pending for review, but not the draft ones,&#8221; or, &#8220;I want the ones published by a certain author.&#8221; So these, in the list here, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s actually available in the admin section now. I&#8217;m not quite sure. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Not as complex as this filter looks like in this PR. It feels like it&#8217;s going a step ahead, and what I think is very powerful is how this can be used, not just where it&#8217;s being used right now, but in any other place that a plugin author may want to implement it, or in the future, we&#8217;re going to see it in other places in the admin panel. So yeah, I think it&#8217;s really powerful, and they&#8217;re working really hard on making this something that can be used in many ways. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and in the pages state of view, they added some quick actions. The quick bulk actions. I think bulk actions is the one from the admin where you can say, &#8220;Okay, I want this page, and this page, and this page,&#8221; and then delete them all, or change something, or something like that. Yeah, and now, that&#8217;s also in the new ones. And the last one from the data view, there are tons of changes in the data views. Some were incremental changes, but one is that the updates…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, so I wanted to talk about the index page for the templates, because it now shows three different views of it. So you could have a table. So the templates are your archive pages, your single post template, and all that, and you can see them all in a list, or you use the toggle for the layout, and you can see a grid view, and the grid view gives you a little small preview of the template, so you know exactly what it will show with a featured image with where the content is, and all that, or you can have a list, but then, there&#8217;s another pane that gives you a preview of the full page, full template, where you can also edit it, so that, from table, to grid view, to list view, those are the different prototypes for the admin designs, and it&#8217;s really smooth how they move, and with all the animations, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. I&#8217;ve been looking at the PRs, and the contributors take a lot of care into the performance aspect of the changes. They are keeping close tabs into what the performance looks like. So these improvements, they&#8217;re going to be very important when this goes all over the admin. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So the next item on my list was in the site editor, the featured image is now, or in the site editor that we can look at, the post editor, the featured image section is now moved up to the top of the inspector control, which is….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I&#8217;m very excited about that. It feels like it&#8217;s such a small change, but it&#8217;s something that you want to be up top there, so I&#8217;m really excited that that finally made it. That&#8217;s the kind of thing that it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Why is it that hidden?&#8221; And it&#8217;s also something that it&#8217;s toggled, so you need to click it before you see it. So now, it&#8217;s up there, right where you need all the info for your photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the web pages become more and more just also visually, need to be visually attractive. You need to have a featured image for the social posts. Yeah, so it&#8217;s such a strong piece of your design that it should be more in the forefront, as it is now. Yeah. Yeah, speaking of featured image, you can now use the featured image in a media and text block, which I find exciting, because you don&#8217;t need to use complicated columns. Yeah, you can just use a media and text block for your featured image, and the title of your post, and then it kind of shows up in a great way, and you don&#8217;t have it as a background, or as a cover, or something like that; it&#8217;s just the picture has its own right, actually, in your header of your post, or in your archive pages. Yeah, so I really like it. Have you seen any designs for that yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>No. You&#8217;ve seen that particular block, but I can think of a few things that I&#8217;ve worked on that try to replicate the same thing with columns, and I&#8217;m glad that now, we can do it with the media and text block, which is probably simpler than those solutions that we built. So yeah, I&#8217;m excited to have another tool for the theme developers to get those featured images in your posts. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, media and text block is actually quite versatile in how you can use it, and also, the expanding of the picture when the text goes bigger, and yeah, it&#8217;s all some automation in there. That was very intriguing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> And the responsive controls, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It was very intriguing to me, yeah, when I first kind of encountered it, and we mentioned it before, for the featured image, now, you can attach a box shadow or a drop shadow around it. It has support for that now. So you could have borders that are rounded plus a drop shadow on your featured image in the single post. It&#8217;s really cool. Yeah, I like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So the layout changes are part of the grid layout experiments? Have you experimented with those grid layouts that are coming to WordPress, or to the Gutenberg Times?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I have tested some of the PRs. This is not yet on Core, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, it&#8217;s on 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Okay. Yeah, so that&#8217;s the reason why I haven&#8217;t used it in a production-ready theme, but I&#8217;m really excited. I&#8217;m following it, because I think it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s the future of layout in WordPress. So I&#8217;m super stoked about how fast it&#8217;s moving, because grid is so complicated, and thinking about a UI for grid, that it&#8217;s both complex enough to give you all the tools that you need for those complicated layouts, while are still being friendly for users who don&#8217;t know how grid works in CSS, it&#8217;s an incredible difficult accomplishment. So I&#8217;m really excited to see it advance, and it&#8217;s looking really, really promising. I really think it&#8217;s the future for theme layout. So I&#8217;m really looking really closely into those features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So right now, you can only experience it when you enable the grid layouts in the experiments section of the Gutenberg plugin, but it&#8217;s really eye-opening how it all works, and there are two new features in there, that one is to have start row, and column start and row start controls in the grid so inside the grid, so you can drag and drop around blocks, and use the drag and drop, which is, visually, much easier to accomplish than trying to figure out which column to put where, something wherever, and another one is that you can group blocks in a grid, so you have six paragraphs, and then you highlight them all, and you click the grid button, and then it arranges them in whatever grid you say, three by three, three by two, four by two, kind of&#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s actually really magic. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It&#8217;s magic. It&#8217;s magic, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah, and it&#8217;s just so amazing that this is possible in WordPress, where you never had any layout tools before. Yeah, so yeah, we are really happy about that. The next thing is that, also, in the site editor, when you look at styles, up until now, you have just the style variations, but now, you also have access to the color and the typography presets in the same page or same column. So you can say, &#8220;Okay, I want this style variation, but I want it in a different color, and I want a different font for that.&#8221; So that informs your whole site as well. You don&#8217;t have to do it for every block, and every template, or something like that. Yeah, so this is really powerful to kind of bring the global styles, not only to the style variations, but also to color and typography presets. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, sometimes you really like everything about a style variation, but the colors or the typography, and now, you can mix and match however you like, which is nice having the extra option, and I think it&#8217;s also a stepping stone for more changes, in that vein, that will come. So yeah, I&#8217;m excited about that, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, and it&#8217;s also visually pleasing. So if you try that out, then when you use the Gutenberg plugin, you have some great visual representation of what the presets would be like, and also, when you click on it, you have a preview on the right-hand side, so you know what you get yourself into. So it&#8217;s really good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">APIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a new API for developers, and that is the plugin document settings panel. So in the document settings, you can have, now, a slot fill, where you, as a plugin developer, you can have put additional fields in there, additional information, and additional controls, and it&#8217;s now available, also, for the site editor. You could do this on the post editor, but now, it&#8217;s also available for the site editor. So there&#8217;s this matching-up with post editor and site editor kind of becoming the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yes. Yeah, that&#8217;s important.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bug Fixes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh yeah. There&#8217;s one bug fix that I really love, and that&#8217;s the code bug. Finally. So yeah, especially for the developer blog, yeah, we had a few code examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I see why you highlighted it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; where we had to kind of spend hours, no, not hours, but at least a half an hour, very tedious work, to remove the breaks, and kind of have new lines in there in code view. So, now, that&#8217;s finally solved, and yeah, we can now start writing again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Focus your time on what&#8217;s important, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, it&#8217;s actually very soothing. It&#8217;s almost meditative doing that, but you need to be in the mindset for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Put on some music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, put on some music. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think I wanted to highlight one of the documentation things. So, if you, as plugin developer, or agency developer, are interested in the data views, there is a&#8230; Well, all the components are in a storybook kind of site that gives you a representation outside of context of a component, and you can see all the attributes for it, and you can try it out, and they just updated the story for the data views component, and so it&#8217;s easier for if you want to kind of experiment with it, or, in your research, you can definitely use it now, and get a better handle on how the data views would maybe work for you in your plugin, and give us your more complicated custom post types that you might have. I will link the story to this DataViews component into the show notes so you don&#8217;t have to hunt it down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that was it. That&#8217;s all from the Gutenberg plugin 18.0. Of course, if you&#8217;re interested in any of the other 209 PRs, the release post will be on makeblog/core later, after we&#8217;ve finished recording, but way before this podcast is published, so we&#8217;ll have it there for you in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we&#8217;re at the section of what&#8217;s in active development or discussed, and I wanted to point out for you, dear listeners, what&#8217;s coming with the admin design. We know we see a few things already in the site editor, and as kind of a prototype of Saxon Fletcher from the design team showed in the video how the next version of DataViews, the admin pages, could work, and it&#8217;s an insightful 18-minute video shared in the design channel, and he summarizes the most recent thinking, particularly about layout and transitions in and out of the editor, and walks us through some of the Figma views and prototypes. It also goes into details about some of the Core paradigms, and if you&#8217;re not part of the WP Slack, you can also watch it via the latest design share on the Make design blog. So, Maggie, did you watch it? What was the most intriguing for you, or what was it from it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, we talked about the DataViews earlier, and I think it&#8217;s really exciting to see how it&#8217;s shaping up. I think one of the comments that he makes is probably what some of the people have mentioned, about how the drilldown on the sidebar looks like, and how you&#8217;ve got to kind of click too many times to get where you want, and if you want to go back, you got to get taken back again, and it&#8217;s nice that they&#8217;re looking into that, and see if they&#8217;re going to iterate on that design. I think it&#8217;s really important for extenders, and even just regular users, to look into those design explorations, and give them feedback, because there&#8217;s only so many things that the design team can take into account, even though they make a great job at trying to figure out all use cases, and all probable ways of using the WordPress admin, but if you have feedback, I think this is the key moment to give it. So go ahead and look at the video. It&#8217;s really exciting. I think it looks really good, and I&#8217;m super stoked to see it actually live, and maybe even work on it. I really enjoyed, particularly, the color stuff, so I&#8217;ll delve into that, if I can chime in on that, but yeah, absolutely 100% look into it and give feedback, because now is the moment. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, what struck me as really interesting to see was how the new layout, we talked about the layout being on the left-hand side, being the menu, and then you get a list view, and then a preview, that has also been explored to use with more complicated custom postings, like a product, for instance, that has a few additional settings that you need to enter it, and he showed, very nicely, how that can be done in that content area in the middle of it, and then you could either switch to settings of the product, and have additional tabs, and additional fields and forms, or you could go and edit the product in an editor view. So I think there&#8217;s some great explorations there, in terms of more complicated custom post types, and to see those in a more modern interface is, really, it&#8217;s quite exciting for me. Yeah, and I can see how, because the admin designs are all extensible right now, and that accessibility needs to come back. So yes, so&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. WordPress needs plugins to live. Plugins are the soul of WordPress, so having them be more consistent with the general admin field is going to make WordPress, in general, a better experience for any users, whatever the plugins are. So that&#8217;s really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, in the Figma space section, it also showed some of the standard colors, and how the variables for primary, secondary, and tertiary could work out, but he also had a section in there where he changed a whole palette from light to dark, and then every screen would also follow suit, and how that is already thought through about it because admin themes are, I think on Core, we have six or seven admin themes, and plugins add additional ones there, so that needs to be taken care of as well. And with the Figma place, where all the standards are, it&#8217;s probably easier for the plugin developers to make decisions, and to come forward to going to production much faster than before, because they don&#8217;t have to invent the wheel over and over again. Yeah, so that&#8217;s an active discussion on the design team, and I have a link for you in the show notes, and, with that, we are at the end of the show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maggie, it has been a great pleasure to chat with you, and I hope you&#8217;ll come back in a few months for another Gutenberg Changelog episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Absolutely. Yeah, I would be really happy to. It&#8217;s been a pleasure for me. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you, Maggie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Thank you so much for inviting me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Absolutely, and the pleasure was all mine. So, before we end the show, I want to remind everyone, April 9th, next Developer Hours on the Interactivity API at 1400 UTC.

In Naples, it was just a normal weekend, and you could get groceries over the weekend, and other shopping done.  Here it is a four-day weekend with Good Friday and Easter Monday as bank holidays and except for Saturday, almost all shops are closed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday, everyone was out grocery shopping for the long weekend. We went to our weekly neighborhood market and were surprised by the long queue in front of every stand. People weren&#8217;t deterred by the pouring rain. It took us twice as long to make our purchases then in a normal week. I bet the lines would have been even longer without the rain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We bought the first white asparagus already, some fish salad and graved lachsforelle from the local trout farmer, vegetable from the local farmers and butter and eggs from the local dairy farmers. At each stand, during the cash payment process you have a little chat with the merchant. I cherish these moments in the non-online, the analog world, that hasn&#8217;t changed for centuries. Interpersonal connections are so much richer than anything that can happen online,  writes she who has been building websites for 28 years. Anyway.
