I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have with me today a couple of guests, Ryan Welcher and Mario Santos, who have joined me to talk about the Interactivity API. This is an API that we&#8217;ve been working on for quite a while, and it&#8217;s a fascinating thing. It&#8217;s really specifically user-facing in its functionality but makes a lot of work streamlined for everyday developers, whether you are building something for yourself, for your family, or for a client. This whole project probably is gonna really speak to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hi, guys, and welcome to the show. First-time guests, both of you. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:15] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yes. First time for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:17] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thanks for inviting us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Well, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, like your name, what you do with WordPress, how you contribute to the project, something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I can go first. My name is Ryan Welcher. I&#8217;m a developer advocate and sponsored by Automattic. Then, I contribute full-time to the WordPress project by creating documentation, doing live streams, creating videos, and just generally trying to be helpful in in the space to help engineers and extenders work with the various APIs in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love the just generally trying to be helpful part. Mario, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:52] <strong>Mario:</strong> He really is. He really does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:55] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m Mario Santos. I&#8217;m also a sponsored contributor, and I&#8217;m more focused on the project management and developer. I consider myself a mix of both. Right now I&#8217;m working on projects that are focused on improving the developer experience especially. That can go from the Block API to the Interactivity API; that is the topic today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Very nice. Very nice. Just lots of helping that everyone&#8217;s trying to do. I think that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;re talking about the Interactivity API today. And, Mario, I believe it was almost a year ago that you first put this proposal out into the WordPress project. Do you wanna tell us a little bit about just, like, where the idea of this came from? Like, I know it wasn&#8217;t originally called the Interactivity API, but, like, what was you said you do some a bit of product, a bit of development. Like, what was it about this idea that was so important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:48] <strong>Mario:</strong> Yeah. Sure. So, basically, well, the proposal came, like, one year ago, but it has been in the works, like, for many years, I would say. Just to give a bit more context, previously, before being a sponsored contributor, I was working at a startup called Frontity Framework, and we were building a React framework to enable rich user experiences on top of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So basically, it was a framework for headless WordPress. And at some point, we became sponsored contributors, the idea was to bring those user experiences to those rich and cool websites that lead to WordPress. So, you don&#8217;t need an external framework to create them, and you can do that directly in WordPress. So that&#8217;s where the idea of the Interactivity API comes from. From there, we started exploring different possibilities and tailoring it more to WordPress to ensure it works with its APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think after many many months working on that, the Interactivity API is the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I just wanted to note that you started that answer with, like, the proposal was about a year ago, but the work had been happening for a long time. I think that&#8217;s generally true, and it&#8217;s not something that we always really acknowledge. This happens with patents also. This is going to be a strange tangent, but this is how we do in in my brain. This is how my brain works. So frequently, you&#8217;ll see a brand new product, but the patent for it was, like, 30 years beforehand, like, way before you ever see anything. And I think that&#8217;s kinda how this works also with software development. Like, the idea, has been going for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The problem was identified a long time ago. And by the time you see something that helps to solve the problem or bring a new set of features to you, like, you didn&#8217;t know, but it had been being worked on for, like, five years or something. And I think that&#8217;s such a fascinating thing. That&#8217;s always apparent to me, but I think it&#8217;s not really apparent for a lot of people in the, in I don&#8217;t know, who use software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna say in the space, quote, unquote, but that&#8217;s not even it. Like, it&#8217;s the people who are using software. We don&#8217;t know how long anything&#8217;s been under development. We just know that at some point, a magical thing appeared, and we get to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So speaking of the problems that we have identified that we&#8217;re trying to solve with this. Like, was there an inherent problem that you all were trying to solve as you were coming up with this idea around the Interactivity API itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:16] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say that trying to summarize it, it covers many things, but the main problem was that creating those kinds of interactions in the client was kind of difficult. You had to manage many things many tools, and each developer could come up with different solutions, and maybe they don&#8217;t combine well together. So, the idea is to provide an extended way so developers don&#8217;t have to take care of many things. They just have to take care of the interactions they wanna create. And ensuring that it works well with the WordPress way, it works well with the block system, and any block created with this Interactivity API can communicate with each other. You can combine those blocks, and you are not gonna encounter any problem. So, I would say that the main issue we were trying to solve is that there wasn&#8217;t a standard solution. There were different approaches taken by different developers, and that could create some issues. So, until now, Gutenberg has been mainly focused on the editor side and how blocks are created. And this is a first attempt to to cover the part of the front end, the interactions that users may want to create in the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] <strong>Ryan:</strong> It solves a ton of problems. But, I mean, coming from someone like, I have a fair amount of agency experience. I&#8217;ve been, you know, you&#8217;re working on large projects. And every time someone solves a problem, they solve it slightly differently. And that&#8217;s problematic because you switch teams or, you know, someone else picks up the code base, and all of a sudden, now they have to learn your custom system that&#8217;s slightly different from the one that I built last week and the one that, you know, someone else built two weeks earlier. And this takes the guesswork out. It takes the sort of the plumbing out of the equation. One of the reasons I really loves working with WordPress when I started working with WordPress was that when I was building for clients, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building the CMS. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building a menu system or figuring out how to handle media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:10] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I just had to do the things that that client was paying me to do. Like, I just had to make their site look the way that they wanted it to. And with the Interactivity API, I think there&#8217;s a bit of that where I don&#8217;t have to worry about figuring out how am I gonna get all these pieces to talk to each other on the front end. It&#8217;s all there. I just have to connect the dots, and it makes it very, very simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m building the site right now for a workshop that I&#8217;m gonna be giving a WordCamp Asia, which is a a shameless plug. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Coming up so fast, y&#8217;all. WordCamp Asia is, like, two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I&#8217;m so excited. I have so much work to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve built an entire voting system on a website where people can pick what we&#8217;re going to be talking about in my workshop, and I built it in the Interactivity API, and it took me, you know, probably five hours. And that&#8217;s me trying to learn some things and mess around with it. And to do that without the Interactivity API would have probably been an entire React-based, you know, completely outside of WordPress. I would have loaded one thing on the page and had it build out my whole application, and now I&#8217;m doing it with blocks and I&#8217;m doing it with a block theme. So if I wanna move those blocks around. I can move the blocks around. I can change anything that I wanna change inside of WordPress the way I would normally, and all that in interactivity just still works. And that&#8217;s It&#8217;s awesome. I just I love it. I can&#8217;t like, the Interactivity API, not my website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But also both. Like, it can be both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> I wanted to say that I think it&#8217;s a great point. I like to think about it like having the best of both worlds. Right now, we have modern frameworks like React, Vue that are used to create these cool websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the Interactivity API plus WordPress brings everything together. Like, you can create those cool user experiences while keeping the full power of WordPress, its management system, the Block editor, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything like that out there. Like having the best of both both worlds because we are still working with blocks, and that&#8217;s amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Given that it&#8217;s still, it&#8217;s not even been released yet. Like, it&#8217;s coming very soon. But.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. This is all still in the Gutenberg plugin. So, like, if you don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, get the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> But just how mature the API is now, considering it is still kind of not even fully released, it&#8217;s only gonna get better? I just think it&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, kudos to Mario and your team for doing all this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you. Kudos to everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, I&#8217;ve a question that I think probably, Ryan, you can start with, but then also probably, Mario, you&#8217;re gonna have some opinions on also. In this conversation so far, we&#8217;ve done a lot of, like, when you want to have these interactions and also when you want to have these cool experiences. For folks who actually do not know what the Interactivity API is yet, and they don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about when we say these interactions like, what exactly are we talking about from a user perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, what types of things will users be able to see when they are experiencing the Interactivity API&#8217;s features and functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a great question. From a user standpoint, it&#8217;ll just look like your regular website, I think. Depending on what you&#8217;re doing. So, like the interactions that we&#8217;re talking about is when you&#8217;re in the browser and you wanna click a button and expand something, for example, or you wanna click an image and have the lightbox pop-up, which is in core now, that&#8217;s driven by the Interactivity API, but these interactions are basically when a user wants to interact with something, what it does. That&#8217;s a really generic way of saying it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Our current favorite example and, Ryan, it sounds like you also have another example. But our current favorite example is like a movie collection site, you know? And so, like, when we&#8217;re talking about what the Interactivity API is going to power, it&#8217;s things like, when you favorite a series of movies, and then you can, and it just updates that on the fly, and you&#8217;ll be able to in essentially real-time as instant as reasonably possible based on your computer and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like, then look at your list of things that you favorited or things like that. Like, for folks who don&#8217;t understand interactive site like, all of us know that that, like, if you get on a site, you have interacted with it. But when we&#8217;re talking about Interactivity API, we&#8217;re talking about types of direct actions users can take. Right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:19] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are just only triggered by some actions. It could be scrolling, clicking, or, or whatever. But, it can go from a simple example like drop down or a popover to more complex things like the movies demo, where you can navigate and the page is not reloading, and that allows you to play a trailer. It starts in a pop-up, and you can keep navigating through different pages, and the trailer keeps playing without reloading. Another example could be instant search; like you start typing the search, and it directly updates the list of films, in this case, that are shown, those kinds of things that happen In the browser. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And Ryan said you, you said that you, like, built a whole survey system, A whole polling system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah, a voting system. So there&#8217;s a series of buttons, each one representing a certain topic, and people can vote, and it tallies the amount. So each, I&#8217;m calling them recipes, has amount of time associated with it, and then so you vote until you run out of time, at which point, like in its tracking it all, and it&#8217;s showing you how much time you voted, how much is left, and once you&#8217;ve run out of time it blurs like it disables all of the voting buttons so you can&#8217;t add more because you run out of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So if you remove one, you can add again. It&#8217;s very, very powerful. And, like, before the Interactivity API, you would have to have, I would have built that whole thing in React, and it would have been one single application that just get loaded on a page. And I just think it&#8217;s amazing. And, like the, the ability to create what are called, like, single page applications or what have always sort of been called SPAs or single page applications where you&#8217;re not reloading the browser every single time you click on a link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to do some things to make that work, but that&#8217;s just available to you and in WordPress. That&#8217;s amazing. I just think that&#8217;s so neat. I mean, it&#8217;s already powering things like the Query Loop block has the ability to move pagination without reloading the page, which is, sounds like a sort of a like a okay, great, like sort of, you know, mundane thing but imagine you had two or three different query loops sitting on your homepage and you wanted to be able to paginate through each one and not refresh the page. That&#8217;s a fantastic user experience that now is just enabled and otherwise was not possible prior to the Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I feel like the Query Loop block was, like, a three-year project four years ago. And I had forgotten about it, which is surprising because I was so concerned with it when we were working directly on it all the time. But yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly the kind of example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve talked about kind of the user thing and people who are gonna build stuff for clients. But, like, if you&#8217;re a contributor and you want to figure out more about either how to use this or how to expand on what is already there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We already talked about how it&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. It&#8217;s kind of experimental over there. But, like, do you all have like, good first bugs? Things that can be worked on in there? Or is there, like, an experiment zone where people can just be like, this is what I tried with the Interactivity API until it broke? How do people work with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would like to clarify first, it&#8217;s right now, it&#8217;s private in, it&#8217;s a private API in WordPress core in 6.4, And it&#8217;s public in Gutenberg, but it&#8217;s gonna be a public API already in WordPress 6.5. So, yes. Anyone can start testing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to get involved is first sharing what interactions you want to see. I mean, everyone has different ideas, and we will love to know the interactions that people want to create using the Interactivity API, so that would be the first step. Then, test it, create your own blocks or site, and send feedback what do you like what you don&#8217;t like. Raise issues, and for that, we are mainly using GitHub. We created a new category in GitHub in the Gutenberg plugin discussions, and we try to to keep everything there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So if you have any questions any feedback, you can share it there. You can also find more discussions about the road map, the change log, many things that are going on right now. And, yeah, I would say those are the ways of getting involved, and I can also expect, maybe Ryan can tell you more here, to start working more on tutorials or videos or whatever. And for me, personally, I would love to see the community working on that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:43] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah. I can, yeah. I think that from a contributor standpoint, especially those who are trying to get into contributing, because, I mean, it&#8217;s not not complicated. Let&#8217;s put it that way, like the Interactivity API. And that&#8217;s not meaning to be a barrier to anyone, but a great place to start is documentation. A great place to start is going through those docs and making sure they&#8217;re up to date and, you know, saying, oh, well, that&#8217;s supposed to do this, so let me go try that. And if it works, great. If it doesn&#8217;t, you know, file a bug, update the documentation, that&#8217;s a great way to get started. It&#8217;s gonna familiarize yourself with the code base and what it&#8217;s supposed to do. And then, sort of, just through osmosis, you&#8217;ll start to pick up more about it. And for anyone starting to contribute to the WordPress project in general, I would say starting with documentation or unit testing is a really, really great way to kinda, dip your toe in the water and not feel too frustrated. And tutorials and demos and show us what you&#8217;re building. We wanna see it. I mean, send it to me, and I will show everyone that I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I mean, we wanna see what what people are building with it and because, you know, just like WordPress, I always use this example, but, like, people used to hack WordPress until we got a hook added for that particular thing that they were adding. So, if we don&#8217;t know what people are building or wanting to build with it, we can&#8217;t make those things happen. So knowing what people are building, how they&#8217;re building, and what they can&#8217;t build, what they&#8217;re running into, what issues they&#8217;re running into is the best way to contribute. So, so people smarter than me can build it for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that call out, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, you know, the theory of tech adoption. And for things like the Interactivity API where we&#8217;re still kind of in the early adopter phase like, Ryan, you&#8217;re an early adopter. You&#8217;re doing everything you think you want to be able to do until it breaks. And, like, I love, like, test it till it fails as a concept of how to get involved in something because, like, you&#8217;re just experimenting, and we encourage experimentation in open source and in open source software and certainly in WordPress. And so, like, it is an unusual thing to think of, like, the best way that I can give back to this project, that I can contribute to this project and make sure that it continues to succeed long term is by using it until the wheels fall off and then tell people what made the wheels fall off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that is a change in thought, But you&#8217;re right. Like, it&#8217;s a very old school open source idea to just get in there and see where it breaks, and tell us. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all we need. And I love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But I just passed my 9-year anniversary being a sponsored contributor, and I was in WordPress for a little bit before it. And so, like, I&#8217;m officially the old guard of us, and so the fact that I&#8217;m, like, so excited about the fact that people are gonna come in and break Mario&#8217;s stuff. Mario, don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s how it works. But also, like, I do find that very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:31] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m willing to see how people break things; that&#8217;s what we need. I totally agree with your reasoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. So I do have kind of, just, like, a final question for y&#8217;all. If there were one thing that you wanted the people who are listening to the WordPress Briefing to know about the Interactivity API, like a hidden gem, a little secret trick. Like, what would it be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] <strong>Mario:</strong> For me, the most exciting part of the Interactivity API is the functionality the client-side navigation enables because there are many, many things there. And I&#8217;m sure that there are many things we haven&#8217;t thought about yet, and the community will come up with some ideas and that would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:17] <strong>Ryan:</strong> For me, the thing is, I love how integrated it is with WordPress, and I know a lot of thought has gone into that without getting too into the weeds. The reasons the decisions that were made were made was so all the hooks and filters and all that goodness that we&#8217;ve had for 20 years is still gonna work. And with the HTML API, the tag processor stuff that&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, it&#8217;s just so cool. It works so well with WordPress. It just works and that&#8217;s probably it for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I work with it, I&#8217;m not having to do any weird janky filtering or stuff that, like, you know, the things that I want to do are not hindered by the Interactivity API. The rather, I&#8217;m able to do more things because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> I prefer Ryan&#8217;s answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:00] <strong>Mario:</strong> It&#8217;s something really important and it&#8217;s something we usually take for granted that it just works with WordPress APIs and the Block Editor, but if you think more about it, it&#8217;s amazing. Like, It&#8217;s what makes it really powerful, I I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For what it&#8217;s worth, I think that&#8217;s true for a lot of, like, the R&amp;D type things that we&#8217;re working on in the project right now. Right? Across Our ecosystem, like WP Playground. It is mind-boggling how progressive that is as a concept, and we currently have, like, you know, 25 ideas about what we could do with it, and we&#8217;re currently working on, like, five because we&#8217;ve got two and a half developers on it or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, like, the expectation that it will just work is there for everybody who has, is not part of the R&amp;D process, but for everyone else who&#8217;s, like, been watching its development over time, shocking. Shocking that it works at all. Not because it wasn&#8217;t supposed to work, but because, like, if someone had asked you five years ago if it was gonna be possible to run WordPress development environments locally and then also just export it and import it into whatever host you want. Like, without a host, without a server, we would all think that you were nuts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:22] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Amazing what&#8217;s happening there and, like, some of the things that we&#8217;re seeing, people who are, like, researching with AI in the WordPress space doing? Equally shocking. All of these things. Like, had you said anything to me about it five years ago, I&#8217;d be like, well, that is a mystery. So, every once in a while, I do have wild ideas about things that I wish we could do with our software. And so yesterday, I went and looked at a prototype for something that someone built based on a wish that I had in 2019. In 2019, I was like, you can play Skyrim on an Amazon Dot using just your voice. So like, why can&#8217;t we build a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then in 2021, someone prototyped that for me. It was ridiculous. It was very bad. It was hilarious. But, also, like, it took 35 minutes to create a &#8216;Hello world&#8217; page, which was ridiculous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, like, what we&#8217;re looking at, the research that I keep seeing from that AI space is people saying, like, I&#8217;m gonna put in a plain text prompt. I need a website as a yoga instructor who also makes custom hats. Right? And then, like, poof. You have this thing that kinda looks like a website with your basic functions and features using the blocks that we have created for WordPress. Like it&#8217;s fascinating how far it&#8217;s come. And that&#8217;s in 2021. It was literally impossible the last time that I was talking about it with anyone, equally literally impossible. Everyone&#8217;s like, plain language prompts for stuff, like that is just a pipe dream. Get away from us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I keep seeing, like, these demos of the research, and it&#8217;s not as far away as we all thought it was. For all these things, Playground, Interactivity API, The AI research is being done. Like, we&#8217;re just a walking R&amp;D group over here in WordPress, and I love it. It&#8217;s fascinating. We&#8217;re just making the impossible possible every day, and I think that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sorry. I got really sidetracked. Do y&#8217;all have anything that you wanted to be sure to share about either the Interactivity API or anything that&#8217;s coming up? Something you wanna make that our listeners know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would just like to emphasize that we love feedback. Please share your feedback. If you test it, yeah, if you think it&#8217;s bad feedback, share it with us as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s especially the feedback we like. I don&#8217;t like this part. That&#8217;s great. We we want to know because the idea is that it serves all purposes for this kind of interactions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That nothing new, but I would like to emphasize that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You know what? There&#8217;s nothing new under the sun. It&#8217;s fine. You&#8217;re good. You should always tell people what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Ryan:</strong> If you&#8217;re interested in getting started with the Interactivity API and just don&#8217;t have any idea where to begin, there&#8217;s actually a pack there. There&#8217;s a Create Block template. So the Create Block package allows you to to quickly scaffold blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a template that&#8217;s part of the Gutenberg repository. It&#8217;s been published on it and NPM. And it will scaffold a very simple block out for you and it&#8217;ll give you, it&#8217;ll show you all the plumbing and how all the pieces work together. So, I think that&#8217;s a fantastic place to get started. It&#8217;s a very simple block. It just basically shows and hides a message, but it&#8217;s all done via the Interactivity API, but it&#8217;s a really, really great sort of, like, like, &#8216;Hello world&#8217; style. I&#8217;m gonna shamelessly self-promote myself at WordCamp Asia. I&#8217;ll be at WordCamp Asia this year doing a workshop where I will be doing some stuff with your Interactivity API. But, if you&#8217;re there and you wanna chat more about the Interactivity API, I am all ears, and I love talking about this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Cool. Ryan, Mario thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a wonderful conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So I hope that you all find that whole project as fascinating as I find it. The Interactivity API is, I know, something that we&#8217;ve kind of been talking about for a while. It showed up specifically in State of the Word, and it&#8217;s hard to understand how important, how vital that work is going to be until you really get your hands on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I recommend you get in there. You take a look at it. I think also Ryan has a few live streams that he does, and he&#8217;s planning on a couple for the Interactivity API coming up. And so just keep an eye out for all of that as we go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:37] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now that brings us to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, it&#8217;s a bunch of feedback and documentation. So, first things first. Did you know that the Documentation Team holds an online monthly Contributor Day on the fourth Tuesday of every month. It&#8217;s just an online docs day, and I love it. So, the next one that&#8217;s coming up is February 27th. We&#8217;re looking for folks to help. So show up, figure out how to get some docs done, and make the WordPress project easier to follow, one bit of documentation at a time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that I have is a request for feedback. So, we announced in December that we have a new centralized WordPress events landing page on WordPress.org, and we wanted to give more visibility to all kinds of WordPress events across the globe. But as always, we really could use your feedback about what is useful for you, what you had hoped to see, what you didn&#8217;t see. So, leave your comments with any relevant feedback about how you would improve those pages and the text on it. If you&#8217;re missing anything relevant, if there are ideas that you have for what could be there, all ideas are welcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, the third thing that I have on our list today is another documentation thing. So, over the last year, a group of contributors have been working to improve the block development onboarding experience within the Block Editor handbook. That contains over 400 published pages, and the effort in 2023 to kind of overhaul that and make it easier was just the beginning. So, it&#8217;s a daunting task. It&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s complex, but improving documentation is one of the easiest ways to contribute to the WordPress project, especially If there are just quick fixes like typos or formatting. Feedback on the existing content, such as the new block tutorial, is invaluable. And so, if you have not taken a look at those yet, wander over to the show notes, click a link or two, take a look, get some feedback to us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

This reflects project-wide efforts to increase utilization of these respectively. However, positive sentiment about WordPress is down modestly, and more so among contributors. The analysis of the annual survey highlights certain areas that could benefit from increased attention in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the highlights split into three parts: logistics, general trends, and contributor sentiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Logistics</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Completions were up 17% in 2023, though short of a goal to double them, despite increased promotion and partnership with some hosting partners.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Polyglots team translated the survey from English into 9 different languages, the most ever for the survey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Debuted a new platform, Alchemer, for improved accessibility, usability, data collection, administration, and analysis.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The completion rate increased again from last year’s high of 63% to 79% in 2023, proving that investing some time in the new platform and clarifying wording was well worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">General trends</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>NPS* was 30.1 overall, with contributors at 27.9 and non-contributors at 32. The NPS has trended downward since 2021, when it was 45. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>60% of respondents indicate usage of Gutenberg, 8% are unsure, and 12% use something other than Gutenberg and/or the Classic Editor. This is up from 2022 (54%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>45% of respondents indicate that the WordPress Site Editor meets their site-building needs, 26% are indifferent, and 29% disagree.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>61% of respondents indicate familiarity with block themes and plugins. While this question was not asked previously, in 2022, 53% said they had used blocks<br>“In the new site editor.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security, performance, and stability were the top three critical areas respondents considered when building their website, plugin, theme, or style variation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>63% agree that WordPress is as good or better than other CMSs, down from 68% in 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents indicated that the best things about WordPress are that it is open source, has ample plugin options, incorporates good customization, is easy to use, and offers flexibility. This is similar to 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limitless configurations, performance, scalability, accessibility, integration, hosting, and support all saw 100% or more increases compared to 2022 regarding favorite things about WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents cited “too many plugins,” “the site editing experience,” “security,” and “performance” as the top four worst things about WordPress. Most interestingly, though, 16% indicated that none of the 20 topics were terrible, and there was a 43% decrease in the number of people indicating that “site editing is difficult to learn.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search engines and YouTube continue to be the two most common resources for finding information about WordPress, while those writing about WordPress, in general, saw a sharp decline year over year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor sentiment</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>58% of self-identified contributors to WordPress said they agree with the project’s roadmap plans for “Phase 3” and “Phase 4” as a good plan to enhance the WordPress experience for developers, creators, and publishers alike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While about one-third of respondents indicated they contribute to the WordPress project, only about half knew how to get involved, knew about WordCamps and meetups, understood the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com, and knew the benefits of open source.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Of 22 topics, the distribution of the top three things that WordPress needs to focus on from the perspective of contributors was broad, with only a 13.5% raw percentage point (1350 basis points) difference between performance (18.6%) in first position and collaborative editing (5.1%) in 22nd position. This shows a need for more consensus among contributors regarding where to focus resources and/or illustrates that the project has many essential elements with passionate supporters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fewer contributors had a positive experience in 2023 (55%) versus 2022 (64%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Similarly, the feeling of being welcome in the WordPress community among contributors decreased to 57% versus 64% in 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furthermore, contributors feel appropriately recognized less in 2023 (46%) than in 2022 (51%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bringing it all together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 annual WordPress survey participation and results highlight the possibility of survey burnout within the WordPress community and some declining overall satisfaction among contributors. There is an opportunity to increase awareness regarding critical initiatives such as WordCamps and other resources for WordPress users and contributors alike and to increase messaging on improvements made within the project to the CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s planned for 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next iteration of the survey, the plan is to improve the survey’s questions further to ensure they continue to provide valuable insight into the project’s trends. This means some questions will be replaced while others might be refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, plans are being explored to distribute and promote the survey at each of the three annual flagship WordCamps (Europe, U.S., and Asia). This would be in contrast to a single yearly survey. More exploration on this topic will take place in the months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2024/02/2023-WordPress-Annual-Survey-Results-Deck.pdf\">View the 2023 Slide Deck</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reporting.alchemer.com/r/738278_655bbaa5598b14.93675163\">View a web-based version of the results.</a> <em>Note that this link may expire in the future.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>*<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/net-promoter-score-calculation\">What is NPS?</a> Simply put, NPS is a KPI organizations can use to measure how likely it’s [users, clients, members] are to recommend a product or service. It can serve as a general indicator of brand strength and affinity. Most organizations use NPS, which can be used to benchmark an organization in an industry against a set of peers. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dansoschin/\">@dansoschin</a> for the analysis and editorial support.

You’ll find more ways to manage your fonts and styles, notable upgrades to synced patterns, a collection of Site Editor and performance updates to help you get things done, and new ways to leverage design tools in Classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will include breakthrough foundational APIs that will start to transform how you use blocks to build memorable experiences. This release invites you to dig into these early-stage frameworks, discover how you’d like to see them evolve, and have an impact on their future improvements and capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excited yet? Keep reading for some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet the Font Library</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially slated for release in WordPress 6.4, the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59166\">Font Library</a> is one of those great things worth the wait. It gives you new capabilities for efficiently managing a vital piece of your site’s design—typography—without coding or extra steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Font Library, you can handle fonts across your site regardless of your active theme—much like how you manage assets in the Media Library. You can install local fonts or Google Fonts, and it’s easily extensible, with the ability to add your own custom typography collections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Synced patterns get an upgrade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reusable-blocks/\">Synced patterns</a> bring efficiency to the design process, letting you make global changes to particular layouts with minimal effort. However, there’s often a need to make contextual changes when it comes to content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 introduces new enhancements to synced patterns that let you override the content in each specific instance. You can choose what content can be updated within a synced pattern—while maintaining the design and layout you’ve already created. Use it for templated pieces like recipes, testimonials, or case studies that use recurring elements to frame unique content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This major release will introduce overrides for the Paragraph, Image, Heading, and Button blocks, with support for more blocks to come as work on synced patterns continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connecting blocks and custom fields or other dynamic content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will finally make it possible to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53300#issuecomment-1938463648\">connect core block attributes to custom fields</a>. This capability lets you use the value of a custom field without creating custom blocks. For example, a digital publication could use custom fields with Paragraph and Image blocks. It could pull information from its individual staff writer profiles to dynamically display on its team page, like headshots and names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">Block Bindings API</a> powers this functionality and is designed to be extensible enough for developers to connect blocks to any dynamic content—not just custom fields. If your data is stored elsewhere, you can easily point blocks to that new source with only a few lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first step in a larger project to simplify how custom fields and other dynamic content are managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Interactivity API gets baked into Core</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as just a taste in WordPress 6.4 with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/51132\">lightbox feature for images</a> is officially making its way into Core. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks\">Interactivity API</a> is a new framework that offers developers a standardized method to bring interactive front-end experiences, or interactions, to blocks. It aims to simplify the process, with less dependencies on external tooling, while maintaining optimal performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interactions create engaging user experiences, whether showing new comments or fetching search results without reloading a page, allowing visitors to interact with content in real time, or incorporating effects like countdowns and transitional animations that surprise and delight. Check out <a href=\"https://wpmovies.dev/\">this demo site to get a taste of what this framework can do</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.5 is just the beginning of bringing this developer experience into Core. Find out how you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56803\">follow along with the work or lend a hand</a> and test more features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get more from your revisions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Revisions are the markers of progress. For creative projects, they&#8217;re also a welcome fallback when you&#8217;re working through a new design or concept. This release brings more detail to your style revision history in the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/01/22/core-editor-improvement-robust-revisions-in-the-site-editor/\">Style revisions in 6.5</a> present a more detailed picture of your work, with design updates like time stamps, quick summaries that outline changes, and the ability to see a full list of revisions made—not just the previous 100. View revisions from the Style Book to see changes that aren&#8217;t reflected in the template you&#8217;re working on. Style revisions are also newly available for templates and template parts, giving you a broader view of your site’s changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect to see more <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/\">work happening to expand and improve revisions across the WordPress experience</a>. It’s a foundational part of the collaborative editing and workflows focus of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Gutenberg project&#8217;s Phase 3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Classic themes can opt into appearance tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the design experience in Block themes evolves and improves, many of these upgrades are also available for Classic themes. Theme authors can choose to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60118\">add support for appearance tools to any Classic theme</a>—even without the use of theme.json. Opting in gives designers and site creators using Classic themes access to a varied set of design options, from <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-wp-theme-json.php#L576\">spacing and border controls to typography and color options</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching themes can feel like a big undertaking, and for folks who aren’t ready to jump into the flexibility of Block themes, these pathways to adoption can help ease that tension. Once a Classic theme gets initial support for appearance tools, more design options will be automatically added as they become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More design tools are on the way</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each WordPress release brings more thought and attention to the way you can create with the Site Editor. The latest improvements to the design experience help bring your creative vision to life:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/57005\">Background images for Group blocks get size and repeat support</a>, letting you play with subtle or splashy ways to add visual interest to your layouts.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56897\">Aspect ratio support for the Cover block</a> gives you more control over your Cover block images’ shape and size.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57103\">Shadow support added to more blocks</a> to help create layouts with visual depth or add a little personality to your design.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Site Editor updates to streamline your workflow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring ease and simplicity to your site-building process with the latest advancements to the Site Editor’s capabilities, from important interface improvements to upgraded tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going beyond Group blocks, you can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54426\">rename every block in the List View</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55188\">rename</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55292\">duplicate</a> individual patterns to help keep them organized. Other notable UI improvements add access to your block settings with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50273\">quick right-click from List View</a>, adjust preferences with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56510\">consolidated settings in the Editor preferences panel</a>, and the ability to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56295\">block toolbar on hover when you’re in Distraction Free mode</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also notice a cleaner and more unified link-building experience that <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50891\">improves link controls</a>, making it easier to create and manage links in various blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release has a bounty of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33683\">drag-and-drop enhancements</a> to make your editing experience feel more intuitive. You’ll notice helpful visual adjustments, like <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56625\">displaced items in List View</a> when you drag them around to reorganize. You’ll also find that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56070\">drag and drop anywhere you’d like</a> in the Editor, from the very beginning to the end of your workspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Data Views in the Site Editor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every piece of your site comes with a library of information and data. Organizing it, finding what you need, and making informed changes should be as effortless as your site editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 includes <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/55083\">data views</a> for pages, templates, patterns, and template parts. You can view data in a table or grid view, with a new UI for toggling fields and making bulk changes. It’s a refreshing and feature-rich experience that leads the way for the upcoming <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/12/admin-design/\">Admin Redesign project</a> on the WordPress roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plugin dependencies improve the plugin experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 improves <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/57545\">how users manage plugins that require other plugins</a>. Plugin authors can supply a new <code>Requires Plugins</code> header with a comma-separated list of required plugin slugs from the WordPress.org Plugins repository, which will present users with links to install and activate those plugins first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Required plugins must remain active and installed for as long as plugins that require them are active and installed. If any required plugins become inactive or uninstalled, the plugins that require them will be automatically deactivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Big performance gains across the editing experience and more</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 contains more than 110 performance-related updates, including an impressive <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57935\">increase in speed and efficiency</a> across both the Post Editor and Site Editor. Loading is over two times faster than in 6.4, with input processing speed increasing to nearly four times faster than the previous release. You’ll also find yourself navigating through the Site Editor six times faster than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loading time for translated sites gets a boost due to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">merging Performant Translations into Core</a>. This greatly improves the load time of translated sites across the board by loading multiple locales simultaneously, making switching between them a faster and more enjoyable experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility highlights</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring that WordPress remains highly accessible is crucial for its success and fulfilling the mission of democratizing publishing. With this in mind, 6.5 will ship more than 65 updates to improve accessibility throughout the platform. These updates include fixes to contrast settings, cursor focus, submenus, positioning of elements, and more.

feature Sunita Rai, a content marketer originally from a remote village in the hills of Nepal. Sunita&#8217;s journey to academic and professional success, with help from the WordPress community, will inspire many.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita Rai at WordCamp Asia\" class=\"wp-image-16707\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=768%2C480&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1536%2C960&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A strong desire to acquire knowledge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools first opened in Sunita’s village in the late 1970s, but most locals, including her parents, had neither the funds nor opportunities to complete their education. Over the years, they realized that an education could open doors for their children. Sunita&#8217;s parents vowed to ensure she received a full education, no matter the costs or hardships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her father worked as a seasonal laborer in India and ensured Sunita and her siblings could go to school with the proper supplies. Her mother cared for everything at home, both the family and the farm. Money was scarce, but determination was abundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish high school, Sunita moved in with her aunt in a nearby city. After graduation, she worked as a teacher. One of the biggest challenges was speaking and writing in English, a requirement for her first job teaching at a private English-language school. Her own education had used Nepali as the language of instruction. Fortunately, she enjoyed writing in English and became more fluent with practice. She discovered that she would always want a career where she could continue learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of a demanding teaching schedule, Sunita continued her studies at a college affiliated with Tribhuvan University. She knew that doing both would be difficult, but she wanted to be able to support her family while pursuing ambitious life and career goals. Earning a bachelor’s degree was a hugely motivating achievement that inspired her to begin a master’s degree in sociology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching for more than five years had been a full-time commitment, with hours of extra work at home. Preparing lessons, grading assignments, and handling exams made it difficult for her to find the time needed for her own studies. Sunita decided she needed more time for her coursework, so she left her teaching job and sought work that would allow her to focus on her studies while still earning money.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita at basecamp Trekking Nepal in November 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16709\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From teaching to writing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After an extensive search, Sunita landed a content writing job at a successful WordPress development firm in Nepal. Her salary as a content writer wasn’t high, but it grew steadily over time. She would later gain some supplementary freelance work after presenting at a WordCamp. She was able to help support her family as she grew in her career, and now she could do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I’m fortunate to have had the education that gave me the capacity to aspire, get into a WordPress job, meet people from around the world, and tell my story!</p>\n<cite>Sunita</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in her career, especially in her early days with WordPress, Sunita benefited from the support of excellent mentors who played pivotal roles in her career development, nurturing her skills in content writing, SEO, and general confidence. Now, she has mentored other content writers and advocates for mentoring programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita speaking at WordCamp Asia 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16706\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=768%2C504&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita has engaged in WordCamps, sharing her wealth of knowledge and experiences. Her first WordCamp was <a href=\"https://nepal.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Nepal 2015</a>, a pivotal moment where she connected with WordPress enthusiasts from various Nepalese and international companies. She experienced a welcoming environment that inspired her to become involved in the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2016\">WordCamp Kathmandu in 2016</a>, Sunita delivered a talk on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/12/01/sunita-rai-seo-copywriting-for-wordpress/\">SEO Copywriting for WordPress</a>, marking a significant milestone in her journey. She later joined a panel discussion titled &#8220;Girls in WordPress – Story, Experience, Opportunity, and Career&#8221; at <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/2018/\">WordCamp Biratnagar 2018</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Sunita helped organize speakers at WordCamp Kathmandu <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2022/\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2023/\">2023</a>, and also spoke outside her home country at <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023\">WordCamp Asia 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://sylhet.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Sylhet, Bangladesh 2023</a>. These events and her <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=sunita%20rai\">talks</a>, helped her grow stronger connections within the global WordPress community and encourage more women speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=900%2C675&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with members from the WordPress Bangladesh community\" class=\"wp-image-16711\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Translating WordPress and empowering others</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and writing in your own language is powerful. For Sunita, translation is crucial in bridging gaps and granting access to those with limited platforms to express and share their passions. When she discovered that she could translate WordPress into Nepali, she joined the many other volunteers on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Translating WordPress to Nepali means empowering my people to access the freedom that WordPress provides.&#8221;&nbsp;</h2>\n<cite>Sunita Rai</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with 3 Female Oganizers WordCamp Kathmandu 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16710\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita emphasizes that coding skills are not a prerequisite for contribution: &#8220;The potential impact you can have on the WordPress community is enormous, across areas from local meetups and WordCamps to testing and translating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights her own experience as a potential path for others. &#8220;WordPress has had a profound impact on my life&#8230; the freedom to work on my own time, to be financially independent, and to overcome my inferiority complex.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her advice to anyone getting started with WordPress: “Get involved in the WordPress community and contribute as early as possible.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;<br><br>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, it is February. For many of us, that means we&#8217;ve already fallen off track on our New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but not you, intrepid WordPresser, especially you, newly found WordPresser who is still on the fence about needing a website, and I get it. It seems like a lot of work, and even if you shoot for the moon, it&#8217;s not clear which star you&#8217;ll land on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It feels easier to open a Facebook page or launch a new Instagram account, get a channel going on YouTube, but here&#8217;s a secret they won&#8217;t tell you. It&#8217;s just as much work. And even if you crack the code on today&#8217;s algorithm, you don&#8217;t own anything you build there, not the content, not the audience. So if you&#8217;re gonna make the effort to build anyway, why not build it in your space? It can be scary to take that kind of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re not convinced yet, let me give you a few other reasons why you should choose a website over some social media thing. I&#8217;ve got a list here, and they build on one another, really. But the first thing is a website covers the five W&#8217;s: who, what, when, where, and why. It&#8217;s basic information, I know, but it&#8217;s what people need to know when they&#8217;re looking at your product or company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phone book, whether you had the yellow pages or the white pages, those are long gone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the need for that information is gone. When people are researching the right service or product to solve their problems, they&#8217;re getting online to do it. So you should be there, and your information should be easy to find.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us right into item number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people know these things about you when, they know who you are, what you&#8217;re doing, when to get to you, where you are, why you&#8217;re doing it. Having that information increases trust and makes you look more professional, and I&#8217;ve seen that be counterintuitive for folks. I mean, it&#8217;s a digital asset, after all. But overwhelmingly, we see consumers who are well-researched by the time they get to us. They&#8217;ve looked at all of your competitors already and checked to see if you are a human, if you share some of their values, and how you manage waste or, complaints, or praise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can never know who is looking for you. So, making it all as clear and easy to see as possible makes you more trustworthy. And the more trustworthy and professional you look, then number three, the more chances you have to bring in good leads and contacts, which can turn into sales or, at the very least, a sales opportunity. And it&#8217;s important to have good leads and contacts. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you have your information out there on a website, then people can sort of prequalify themselves. If they already have a sense for whether they are a good fit for your product or service, then fingers crossed. You can spend most of your time with people who are making serious inquiries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And coming in at four, you can do this any way you want with words or art, NFTs of your latest work, or video tutorials. It lets you tell your story in ways that other mediums necessarily have to limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, importantly, you can still do those things elsewhere. Right? But having essentially a digital home online that is yours, keep your stuff online in a place you own and operate, then draw people to you through those other channels. Make it all work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have a fifth thing, mostly because I like lists of either three or five, and the list I had was four, but also because it&#8217;s true. Number five is still true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting domains is fun. You&#8217;ve got something to share with the world, and your domain name is title and, story, and first impression. And isn&#8217;t it great instead of having to say you can find me at LinkedIn, slash in slash, etc.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can say something quick and memorable. Josepha.blog or whatever it is you registered. Getting domains is fun. It&#8217;s the fifth thing, and I tried to act like it was no big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also, it&#8217;s like one of the first things you have to do, and it&#8217;s kind of a big deal. You can have your own domain, and it can say a lot for you. So there you have it, some basic and not-so-basic reasons why you should have a website. If you are convinced or at least intrigued, I&#8217;ve got a few tutorials that can help you get started that I&#8217;ll link in the show notes.&nbsp;<br><br>[00:05:03] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have four big things for you today: four-ish. So, first things first, I have some early opportunities for y&#8217;all to test our next major release. Our next major release is WordPress 6.5. The target release date is March 26th. But coming up here on February 13th, we have Beta 1 scheduled. That&#8217;s an early opportunity for you to provide feedback. A lot of the features that we have coming in this release are big, and they&#8217;re moving quite quickly. And so, if you are already a routine WordPress user, pop on over into the core channel or onto make.WordPress.org/core and get your hands on that beta release. We could use a lot of feedback from you on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I have is that the second cohort of the Contributor Mentorship Program has opened up, and we&#8217;re calling for participants whether you want to be mentored or mentor somebody. We are accepting applications for both. This is a fantastic opportunity for experienced contributors to help other people learn how to do this. And also, if you are learning to contribute to open source and to WordPress for the first time, I know it can be scary. It took me many, many tries to really get started. And so this is a great opportunity for anyone who is trying to contribute in a new way, in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing that I have is there&#8217;s a post up about Data Liberation in 2024. This is one of our big focuses for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A web where being locked into a system should be a thing of the past, and migrating your site to WordPress or around the WordPress ecosystem should be doable with essentially 1-click, and, so, there&#8217;s a lot of work that we&#8217;re doing there. You can find it on WordPress.org/data-liberation. There will be a link to that in our show notes, but also, there is a lot of work that has to be done, not only to get those resources together but also some companion tools to the resources. So head on over there, take a look at what&#8217;s out there. And if you have some stuff to contribute, share that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And my fourth thing, my final thing, is that WordCamp Asia is about a month away. So you still have time to plan your attendance. If that&#8217;s something that you want to do, head on over to asia.wordcamp.org to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser or specifically for this one; if you liked what you heard, share it with a fellow collaborator whether they know WordPress or not. But if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at wpbriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> Today, we&#8217;ve got a throwback episode about blogging. If you&#8217;re like me, you sometimes miss the early days of blogs, where the words were a little more pensive, and the images were a little less professional. If you&#8217;re on a slow hobby journey like so many of us are right now, give this one a listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:58] (music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning. You may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their own project or business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool. We have long since outgrown that, but even 20 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because, even after those 20 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same, and that is to democratize publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help people have a place online where they can tell their stories, or share their projects, or set up their businesses. If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So, I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, Oh, Jospeha, how old fashioned. I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website. And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, back to the topic at hand, before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first-ever website. So let&#8217;s dive in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So, have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, but also some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first, cause like, if you want the domain name WordPress.org, like, we own that, you can&#8217;t have that. But if you know that you want a domain like &#8216;WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com&#8217; like, that one might be more available. And if you know kind of the words you want in your domain, then you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mention all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it&#8217;s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start before you even know what WordPress is most of the time. So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is, what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date. There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service, where they will keep your WordPress software up to date and provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So it ranges all the way from full service like that, all the way down to essentially zero service, just kind of hands off. They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site, but they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you; they leave updating up to you, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself and the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software, and what you want, and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either services with the existing host that you chose or moving to a different host; however, that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually, most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click, and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, on the other side of that spectrum, that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server, or you know how to work in this thing called cPanel, etc. So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to WordPress.org/download and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment. Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little, I&#8217;ve got you covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the LearnWP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host, as well as various other early steps of this process. If you felt like I blazed through all of that, which, honestly, I kind of did. You can work through those lessons in that course at your own pace, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this &#8216;Hello World&#8217; post. There&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare, like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMSs in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh. We&#8217;ve got now a website. We know kind of how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can be moderated, and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some choose-your-own-adventure guiding questions here. Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words? Mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want, three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to WordPress.org/themes and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to WordPress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically, so that you can see how things look right away. And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site, so if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely. And just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every WordPress instance ships with a theme, and it is fully functional when you get your site up and running, so you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready. And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites, is to add plugins to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality to it. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions? If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there. If that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find. And as a general side note here as well, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine. I&#8217;ll tell you this, I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms, and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So, yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the one hand, you definitely can. And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem and, obviously, hear some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Josepha</strong>: Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for for years, but also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009, and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy. We are the easiest of the hard options for CMSs like content management systems are just complicated. But we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game like you should have had a website for years, I mean, sure, that could be true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second best time to plant that tree is today. WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:18] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:25] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And now, our small list of big things. Today we&#8217;ve got some look-back items and some look-forward items. So let&#8217;s hop right in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing is we have a year in review with the themes team. So much amazing work has been done by the themes team over the past year, both for reviewing themes and creating them. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to those in the show notes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a post out that just has some general celebrations from teams around the community. I&#8217;ll leave a link to that. It probably has been linked in quite a few places, but you know, we don&#8217;t always embrace those moments of celebration. We don&#8217;t always embrace our wins. And so it&#8217;s always good to share those early and often. There are probably more than just those two. So if you posted one or you saw a really interesting one that you think that we should know about, don&#8217;t forget to share it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Next, we have a leap into 2024 with Site Editor tools. So, on the new Developer Blog, if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, there is a lot of excellent content there for whether you are like an advanced developer in WordPress or you&#8217;re kind of intermediate and ready to move into your advanced developer era.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Editor will give you a powerful way to visually create every part of your site and tell your story. And this post will help you to kind of see how to handle everything from big style changes to simple copy updates, all in a single place. We want to make sure that you get the most out of your WordPress this year. And that post will give you a few standout tools and features that you&#8217;ll want to try.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll also want to keep an eye out for updates as we move into 2024 around team reps. So each team in the WordPress project goes through a process to review and elect team reps, and elections are happening now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Along with things that are happening now that you should keep an eye on, the annual goals, our big picture post has gone out as well. It went out at the end of the week last week. There&#8217;ll be a link to all of these in the show notes. And yeah, keep an eye out for, hopefully, a fantastic 2024 in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

That’s why I announced a new initiative called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Data Liberation</a> for 2024. Migrating your site to WordPress, or exporting all your content from WordPress, should be possible in one click. I want WordPress’ export format to become the lingua franca of CMSes, whether coming to WordPress or moving within WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I often hear about folks across the WordPress community duplicating efforts when creating scripts and workflows to move users to WordPress. Imagine if we shared those resources instead and built community-owned plugins that anyone could use! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it should be more than plugins; workflows, tutorials, and helper scripts should be shared, too. I want this resource to have space to include moving from social networks, moving from a page builder to core blocks, switching from classic to blocks, and improving WordPress current canonical plugins for importing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">You can help!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the heart of any open source project is the community that shows up to build it. My hope is that this marks the start of a new contribution pathway, separate from core teams, that allows folks to contribute what they’ve learned and what they’ve created to help others move to WordPress. I expect this emphasis on migration will also influence future development, both in core and with recommended community or canonical plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things that I think will be key to making this project a success:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A dedicated landing page on WordPress.org following a WordPress.org/and/[platform-name] format.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A forum used for non-review user feedback and general discussion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A dedicated Slack channel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Moderation within hours rather than days.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Listed on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress\">WordPress GitHub</a> with syncing for individual commits to SVN for history in both places.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By complementing the community’s existing efforts—the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future program</a>, the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress initiative</a>, a focus on internationalization, etc.—my hope is that this will help even more people see themselves in the WordPress project, providing fresh momentum for <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/\">WordCamps and meetups</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s never been more crucial to champion openness on the web. Bringing focused attention to improved portability will untether users and increase their freedom like never before.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"16736\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WP Briefing: Episode 70: A Look Ahead at WordPress in 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/01/episode-70-a-look-ahead-at-wordpress-in-2024/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 Jan 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=16677\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:264:\"Curious about WordPress\'s big-picture items for 2024?

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hello, my dears, and welcome to 2024. I hope you&#8217;ve had a lovely break. At the top of the year, I like to look around and gather the projects that the community is interested in. We can&#8217;t always commit to everything, and sometimes even the things we plan to do can&#8217;t make it across the finish line. In the next few weeks, I&#8217;ll be publishing kind of the big picture goals for the year, but I wanted to share a little bit about what I&#8217;ve collected so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Firstly, we&#8217;ve got Phase 3. This has been called a few things over the years: collaborative editing, multiplayer, co-editing. But whatever it&#8217;s been called, the biggest changes to writing and design workflows are likely to happen in this phase. A redesigned workflow can be a bit of a shock. But fortunately, we already have a prototype out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll include a link to some resources in the show notes, or of course, you can always stop by make.WordPress.org/core for some insights. But I would encourage you to, at the very least, get your hands on that prototype to see what it looks like is coming in Phase 3 so that you can be aware and provide your feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing on our list is Data Liberation. This is a new-to-us project that was introduced at State of the Word. Fortunately, though, it&#8217;s not a new concept overall. Data Liberation is actually one of the earliest ideas that sold me on WordPress. The idea that you could set up a site for a client, or yourself, and that hard work wasn&#8217;t lost if something went wrong, was really important to me. It&#8217;s been a long time since we put any effort into our importers and exporters, and I think this will be a good focus for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that I&#8217;ve picked up, kind of a list of three things, but there are three mid-sized areas that I want us to pay attention to this year: plugins, old tickets, and new meetups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins, because they really have turned a corner on where they ended 2023. A lot of work has been done to make sure that they&#8217;ve streamlined some efforts, gotten some better onboarding for folks as they&#8217;re going in, and we could really use a hand to keep that momentum going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Old tickets, because it&#8217;s something that we hope for year after year when we&#8217;re talking to people about what they want in new releases. So often, part of what they say is some way to work through all of these old things that have been around forever, some with patches. And why not, after all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then new meetups, because I really still think that meetups are the best intro to WordPress. No matter whether you&#8217;re wanting to become a developer eventually or, like, the community-building aspect is the thing that hooks you forever. Meetups are the place to encourage those and discover those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing on my list is also two things. It&#8217;s two things, but kind of a guess at the moment. There are two summit items that I want us to try to consider this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one is contributor recognition. Acknowledgment and recognition, I think, are two different things, and there was an entire series of sessions at the summit where we talked about it. And so I think that it&#8217;s worth us digging in on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing from the summit that I would really like us to all kind of dig in on is accessibility, how we do it, how we confirm it, what we think we should do versus what we actually do, and see what we can move on the needle there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing is sort of a personal wish. I think it&#8217;s about time that we take a look at the way that we kind of manage ourselves as a project, the way that we do our meetings and report on our successes, things like that. And I realize that this is a big thing, and it might be a little bit scary. But, I mean, we&#8217;ve been doing this for a really long time, and it&#8217;s probably as good a time as any, frankly, to look at what we&#8217;re doing by habit or tradition and see if it still suits us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s my back of the napkin set of notes so far. Keep an eye out in the next couple of weeks for the annual Big Picture post so you can get some context, notes, and discussion opportunities. And, of course, anything that has shown up that&#8217;s a bit bigger, a bit more final will be in there as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, our small list of big things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:52] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Firstly, State of the Word had nearly 200 questions submitted, and Matt has been answering the overflow on make.WordPress.org/project. So, I&#8217;ll include a link, but head on over there to that post if you would like to catch up on those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second item, and last item, is that you&#8217;ve got a few more days left to give us feedback on WordPress meetups in 2023, and give us an idea of what we can do to improve those. I believe those close on January 14th. I really love my local meetup, and I hope that we can get some of that same sort of feeling going in all of yours, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

There’s a lot to cover, and the team is excited to see it released. We’ve got bug fixes, performance improvements, and some breaking changes.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>We’ve trimmed legacy code, removed some previously-deprecated APIs, removed some internal-only parameters to public functions that were never documented, and dropped support for some “magic” behaviors that were overly complicated.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The post includes an overview of the changes, starting with the highlight: dropping support for IE10 and older. The team planned to part with IE11 after Microsoft ended support in 2022 but <a href=\"https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/5077#issuecomment-1730205609\">eventually decided</a> to push this change to v5 to avoid any more blockers to the v4 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming release uses ES modules and switches from RequireJS to Rollup for packaging. It also removes 13 deprecated functions that “were either always meant to be internal or ones that now have native equivalents in all supported browsers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>78 Million Websites Use jQuery</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adherence to modern browser behavior and specs is a common thread in the announcement post. Indeed, browsers have come a long way since January 2006, when jQuery was launched, Internet Explorer had a 90% market share, and front-end development was a constant struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, with <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=es6\">99.84% browser support</a> for ES6, a slew of well-supported <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API\">Web APIs</a>, and robust upgrades to CSS—when we can run a full-blown <a href=\"https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/\">WordPress instance in the browser</a> using WebAssembly—do we still need a 1.25 MB DOM manipulation library?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1al08pe/comment/kpi131o\">the words of an opinionated Redditor</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Look, jQuery was incredible and it changed JS in incredible ways. It made the JS developer experience incredible because it was so inventive. And the JS community and TC39 implemented so many things that jQ did incredible. It was one of the goals of jQ &#8211; set standards and improve the JS language. And it worked. And it&#8217;s no longer needed.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Judging by online statistics, the answer is an unequivocal “YES!”. jQuery might be the uncool kid in the front-end neighborhood, but its market share dwarfs the hipper frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on NPM, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery\">jQuery 3.7.1</a>, released in August 2023, boasts over 9 million weekly downloads and has more than 20k dependent packages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuiltWith <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/jQuery\">indicates</a> that over 78 million websites use jQuery, while W3Techs <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery\">reports</a> that “jQuery is used by 94.4% of all the websites whose JavaScript library we know. This is 77.1% of all websites.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Legacy Dependency</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the chief reasons for jQuery’s relentless popularity is being instrumental to the ecosystem. Namely, it’s bundled in WordPress Core and is part of numerous themes and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress’ adoption of React-based Gutenberg has lowered its dependency on jQuery. During a Developer Hours session hosted a week after Willison’s announcement, titled <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2024/02/13/developer-hours-javascript-for-modern-wordpress-development/\">JavaScript for modern WordPress development</a>, Automattic’s developer advocates Ryan Welcher and Nick Diego spent more than an hour diving into JS tools and techniques to build blocks and editor extensions; they didn’t once mention jQuery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/10/04/the-performance-impact-of-using-jquery-in-wordpress-themes/\">post published</a> in October 2021 on the Make Themes blog, core contributor Felix Arntz urged theme developers to move away from jQuery to improve performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60478\">TRAC ticket opened</a> on the day of Willison’s announcement reported the news and enquired, “Is this something that wp core will be looking to implement?”. Andrew Ozz, Lead Developer at Automattic, replied, “Of course :)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a 43% share of the CMS market, WordPress could be the serum of jQuery’s longevity.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"122\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/jQuery-logo-500x122.png\" alt=\"jQuery\'s logo and tagline: write less, do more\" class=\"wp-image-154072\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The last time WP Tavern <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tag/jquery\">covered jQuery</a> was in 2020, when jQuery Migrate 1.4.1 was removed from WordPress 5.5, causing themes and plugins to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Core team’s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-jquery-migrate-helper/\">Enable jQuery Migrate Helper</a> plugin—<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/enable-jquery-migrate-helper-plugin-passes-10k-active-installs\">launched</a> to tackle these problems—is still maintained and has 100k active installs. It also has some glaring reviews about how helpful it is. Why would people building WordPress websites in 2024 need to use a plugin designed “as a temporary solution, enabling the migration script for your site to give your plugin and theme authors some more time to update, and test, their code.”?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Trailblazer that Moves the Web Forward</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the answer lies in an alarming comment found on W3Techs. A third of the websites that use jQuery run a version older than 3.x (3.0.0 was released in June 2016).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These results correlate with <a href=\"https://openjsf.org/blog/jquery-idc-research\">a smaller-scoped study</a> conducted by the OpenJS Foundation and IDC in November 2023. Out of 509 survey respondents, 89% confirmed they use jQuery, with 56% deploying older versions, some no longer maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open-source and standardization expert Tobie Langel, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2023/03/secure-the-web-forward/papers.html#jquery\">speaking at</a> the W3C’s Secure the Web Forward workshop, believes “jQuery’s massive reach and longevity” puts it in a unique position: if securing jQuery means securing the web, then “Once again&#8211;and against all odds&#8211;jQuery can be a trailblazer and help move the web forward.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s already an ongoing effort: <a href=\"https://openssf.org/blog/2022/10/24/openssf-project-alpha-omega-invests-in-the-openjs-foundation-and-jquery-to-help-secure-the-consumer-web/\">In October 2022</a>, the <a href=\"https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/\">Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Project Alpha-Omega</a> awarded jQuery a $350k grant to “reduce potential security incidents for jQuery by helping modernize its consumers and its code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backed by industry giants like the Linux Foundation, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, and part of the OpenJS Foundation supported by GoDaddy, IBM, Joyent, and the Sovereign Tech Fund, jQuery seems like it will get to live to see more than just another day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How about you?

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have with me today a couple of guests, Ryan Welcher and Mario Santos, who have joined me to talk about the Interactivity API. This is an API that we&#8217;ve been working on for quite a while, and it&#8217;s a fascinating thing. It&#8217;s really specifically user-facing in its functionality but makes a lot of work streamlined for everyday developers, whether you are building something for yourself, for your family, or for a client. This whole project probably is gonna really speak to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hi, guys, and welcome to the show. First-time guests, both of you. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:15] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yes. First time for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:17] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thanks for inviting us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Well, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, like your name, what you do with WordPress, how you contribute to the project, something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I can go first. My name is Ryan Welcher. I&#8217;m a developer advocate and sponsored by Automattic. Then, I contribute full-time to the WordPress project by creating documentation, doing live streams, creating videos, and just generally trying to be helpful in in the space to help engineers and extenders work with the various APIs in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love the just generally trying to be helpful part. Mario, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:52] <strong>Mario:</strong> He really is. He really does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:55] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m Mario Santos. I&#8217;m also a sponsored contributor, and I&#8217;m more focused on the project management and developer. I consider myself a mix of both. Right now I&#8217;m working on projects that are focused on improving the developer experience especially. That can go from the Block API to the Interactivity API; that is the topic today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Very nice. Very nice. Just lots of helping that everyone&#8217;s trying to do. I think that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;re talking about the Interactivity API today. And, Mario, I believe it was almost a year ago that you first put this proposal out into the WordPress project. Do you wanna tell us a little bit about just, like, where the idea of this came from? Like, I know it wasn&#8217;t originally called the Interactivity API, but, like, what was you said you do some a bit of product, a bit of development. Like, what was it about this idea that was so important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:48] <strong>Mario:</strong> Yeah. Sure. So, basically, well, the proposal came, like, one year ago, but it has been in the works, like, for many years, I would say. Just to give a bit more context, previously, before being a sponsored contributor, I was working at a startup called Frontity Framework, and we were building a React framework to enable rich user experiences on top of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So basically, it was a framework for headless WordPress. And at some point, we became sponsored contributors, the idea was to bring those user experiences to those rich and cool websites that lead to WordPress. So, you don&#8217;t need an external framework to create them, and you can do that directly in WordPress. So that&#8217;s where the idea of the Interactivity API comes from. From there, we started exploring different possibilities and tailoring it more to WordPress to ensure it works with its APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think after many many months working on that, the Interactivity API is the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I just wanted to note that you started that answer with, like, the proposal was about a year ago, but the work had been happening for a long time. I think that&#8217;s generally true, and it&#8217;s not something that we always really acknowledge. This happens with patents also. This is going to be a strange tangent, but this is how we do in in my brain. This is how my brain works. So frequently, you&#8217;ll see a brand new product, but the patent for it was, like, 30 years beforehand, like, way before you ever see anything. And I think that&#8217;s kinda how this works also with software development. Like, the idea, has been going for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The problem was identified a long time ago. And by the time you see something that helps to solve the problem or bring a new set of features to you, like, you didn&#8217;t know, but it had been being worked on for, like, five years or something. And I think that&#8217;s such a fascinating thing. That&#8217;s always apparent to me, but I think it&#8217;s not really apparent for a lot of people in the, in I don&#8217;t know, who use software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna say in the space, quote, unquote, but that&#8217;s not even it. Like, it&#8217;s the people who are using software. We don&#8217;t know how long anything&#8217;s been under development. We just know that at some point, a magical thing appeared, and we get to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So speaking of the problems that we have identified that we&#8217;re trying to solve with this. Like, was there an inherent problem that you all were trying to solve as you were coming up with this idea around the Interactivity API itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:16] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say that trying to summarize it, it covers many things, but the main problem was that creating those kinds of interactions in the client was kind of difficult. You had to manage many things many tools, and each developer could come up with different solutions, and maybe they don&#8217;t combine well together. So, the idea is to provide an extended way so developers don&#8217;t have to take care of many things. They just have to take care of the interactions they wanna create. And ensuring that it works well with the WordPress way, it works well with the block system, and any block created with this Interactivity API can communicate with each other. You can combine those blocks, and you are not gonna encounter any problem. So, I would say that the main issue we were trying to solve is that there wasn&#8217;t a standard solution. There were different approaches taken by different developers, and that could create some issues. So, until now, Gutenberg has been mainly focused on the editor side and how blocks are created. And this is a first attempt to to cover the part of the front end, the interactions that users may want to create in the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] <strong>Ryan:</strong> It solves a ton of problems. But, I mean, coming from someone like, I have a fair amount of agency experience. I&#8217;ve been, you know, you&#8217;re working on large projects. And every time someone solves a problem, they solve it slightly differently. And that&#8217;s problematic because you switch teams or, you know, someone else picks up the code base, and all of a sudden, now they have to learn your custom system that&#8217;s slightly different from the one that I built last week and the one that, you know, someone else built two weeks earlier. And this takes the guesswork out. It takes the sort of the plumbing out of the equation. One of the reasons I really loves working with WordPress when I started working with WordPress was that when I was building for clients, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building the CMS. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building a menu system or figuring out how to handle media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:10] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I just had to do the things that that client was paying me to do. Like, I just had to make their site look the way that they wanted it to. And with the Interactivity API, I think there&#8217;s a bit of that where I don&#8217;t have to worry about figuring out how am I gonna get all these pieces to talk to each other on the front end. It&#8217;s all there. I just have to connect the dots, and it makes it very, very simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m building the site right now for a workshop that I&#8217;m gonna be giving a WordCamp Asia, which is a a shameless plug. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Coming up so fast, y&#8217;all. WordCamp Asia is, like, two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I&#8217;m so excited. I have so much work to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve built an entire voting system on a website where people can pick what we&#8217;re going to be talking about in my workshop, and I built it in the Interactivity API, and it took me, you know, probably five hours. And that&#8217;s me trying to learn some things and mess around with it. And to do that without the Interactivity API would have probably been an entire React-based, you know, completely outside of WordPress. I would have loaded one thing on the page and had it build out my whole application, and now I&#8217;m doing it with blocks and I&#8217;m doing it with a block theme. So if I wanna move those blocks around. I can move the blocks around. I can change anything that I wanna change inside of WordPress the way I would normally, and all that in interactivity just still works. And that&#8217;s It&#8217;s awesome. I just I love it. I can&#8217;t like, the Interactivity API, not my website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But also both. Like, it can be both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> I wanted to say that I think it&#8217;s a great point. I like to think about it like having the best of both worlds. Right now, we have modern frameworks like React, Vue that are used to create these cool websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the Interactivity API plus WordPress brings everything together. Like, you can create those cool user experiences while keeping the full power of WordPress, its management system, the Block editor, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything like that out there. Like having the best of both both worlds because we are still working with blocks, and that&#8217;s amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Given that it&#8217;s still, it&#8217;s not even been released yet. Like, it&#8217;s coming very soon. But.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. This is all still in the Gutenberg plugin. So, like, if you don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, get the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> But just how mature the API is now, considering it is still kind of not even fully released, it&#8217;s only gonna get better? I just think it&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, kudos to Mario and your team for doing all this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you. Kudos to everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, I&#8217;ve a question that I think probably, Ryan, you can start with, but then also probably, Mario, you&#8217;re gonna have some opinions on also. In this conversation so far, we&#8217;ve done a lot of, like, when you want to have these interactions and also when you want to have these cool experiences. For folks who actually do not know what the Interactivity API is yet, and they don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about when we say these interactions like, what exactly are we talking about from a user perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, what types of things will users be able to see when they are experiencing the Interactivity API&#8217;s features and functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a great question. From a user standpoint, it&#8217;ll just look like your regular website, I think. Depending on what you&#8217;re doing. So, like the interactions that we&#8217;re talking about is when you&#8217;re in the browser and you wanna click a button and expand something, for example, or you wanna click an image and have the lightbox pop-up, which is in core now, that&#8217;s driven by the Interactivity API, but these interactions are basically when a user wants to interact with something, what it does. That&#8217;s a really generic way of saying it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Our current favorite example and, Ryan, it sounds like you also have another example. But our current favorite example is like a movie collection site, you know? And so, like, when we&#8217;re talking about what the Interactivity API is going to power, it&#8217;s things like, when you favorite a series of movies, and then you can, and it just updates that on the fly, and you&#8217;ll be able to in essentially real-time as instant as reasonably possible based on your computer and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like, then look at your list of things that you favorited or things like that. Like, for folks who don&#8217;t understand interactive site like, all of us know that that, like, if you get on a site, you have interacted with it. But when we&#8217;re talking about Interactivity API, we&#8217;re talking about types of direct actions users can take. Right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:19] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are just only triggered by some actions. It could be scrolling, clicking, or, or whatever. But, it can go from a simple example like drop down or a popover to more complex things like the movies demo, where you can navigate and the page is not reloading, and that allows you to play a trailer. It starts in a pop-up, and you can keep navigating through different pages, and the trailer keeps playing without reloading. Another example could be instant search; like you start typing the search, and it directly updates the list of films, in this case, that are shown, those kinds of things that happen In the browser. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And Ryan said you, you said that you, like, built a whole survey system, A whole polling system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah, a voting system. So there&#8217;s a series of buttons, each one representing a certain topic, and people can vote, and it tallies the amount. So each, I&#8217;m calling them recipes, has amount of time associated with it, and then so you vote until you run out of time, at which point, like in its tracking it all, and it&#8217;s showing you how much time you voted, how much is left, and once you&#8217;ve run out of time it blurs like it disables all of the voting buttons so you can&#8217;t add more because you run out of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So if you remove one, you can add again. It&#8217;s very, very powerful. And, like, before the Interactivity API, you would have to have, I would have built that whole thing in React, and it would have been one single application that just get loaded on a page. And I just think it&#8217;s amazing. And, like the, the ability to create what are called, like, single page applications or what have always sort of been called SPAs or single page applications where you&#8217;re not reloading the browser every single time you click on a link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to do some things to make that work, but that&#8217;s just available to you and in WordPress. That&#8217;s amazing. I just think that&#8217;s so neat. I mean, it&#8217;s already powering things like the Query Loop block has the ability to move pagination without reloading the page, which is, sounds like a sort of a like a okay, great, like sort of, you know, mundane thing but imagine you had two or three different query loops sitting on your homepage and you wanted to be able to paginate through each one and not refresh the page. That&#8217;s a fantastic user experience that now is just enabled and otherwise was not possible prior to the Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I feel like the Query Loop block was, like, a three-year project four years ago. And I had forgotten about it, which is surprising because I was so concerned with it when we were working directly on it all the time. But yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly the kind of example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve talked about kind of the user thing and people who are gonna build stuff for clients. But, like, if you&#8217;re a contributor and you want to figure out more about either how to use this or how to expand on what is already there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We already talked about how it&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. It&#8217;s kind of experimental over there. But, like, do you all have like, good first bugs? Things that can be worked on in there? Or is there, like, an experiment zone where people can just be like, this is what I tried with the Interactivity API until it broke? How do people work with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would like to clarify first, it&#8217;s right now, it&#8217;s private in, it&#8217;s a private API in WordPress core in 6.4, And it&#8217;s public in Gutenberg, but it&#8217;s gonna be a public API already in WordPress 6.5. So, yes. Anyone can start testing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to get involved is first sharing what interactions you want to see. I mean, everyone has different ideas, and we will love to know the interactions that people want to create using the Interactivity API, so that would be the first step. Then, test it, create your own blocks or site, and send feedback what do you like what you don&#8217;t like. Raise issues, and for that, we are mainly using GitHub. We created a new category in GitHub in the Gutenberg plugin discussions, and we try to to keep everything there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So if you have any questions any feedback, you can share it there. You can also find more discussions about the road map, the change log, many things that are going on right now. And, yeah, I would say those are the ways of getting involved, and I can also expect, maybe Ryan can tell you more here, to start working more on tutorials or videos or whatever. And for me, personally, I would love to see the community working on that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:43] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah. I can, yeah. I think that from a contributor standpoint, especially those who are trying to get into contributing, because, I mean, it&#8217;s not not complicated. Let&#8217;s put it that way, like the Interactivity API. And that&#8217;s not meaning to be a barrier to anyone, but a great place to start is documentation. A great place to start is going through those docs and making sure they&#8217;re up to date and, you know, saying, oh, well, that&#8217;s supposed to do this, so let me go try that. And if it works, great. If it doesn&#8217;t, you know, file a bug, update the documentation, that&#8217;s a great way to get started. It&#8217;s gonna familiarize yourself with the code base and what it&#8217;s supposed to do. And then, sort of, just through osmosis, you&#8217;ll start to pick up more about it. And for anyone starting to contribute to the WordPress project in general, I would say starting with documentation or unit testing is a really, really great way to kinda, dip your toe in the water and not feel too frustrated. And tutorials and demos and show us what you&#8217;re building. We wanna see it. I mean, send it to me, and I will show everyone that I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I mean, we wanna see what what people are building with it and because, you know, just like WordPress, I always use this example, but, like, people used to hack WordPress until we got a hook added for that particular thing that they were adding. So, if we don&#8217;t know what people are building or wanting to build with it, we can&#8217;t make those things happen. So knowing what people are building, how they&#8217;re building, and what they can&#8217;t build, what they&#8217;re running into, what issues they&#8217;re running into is the best way to contribute. So, so people smarter than me can build it for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that call out, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, you know, the theory of tech adoption. And for things like the Interactivity API where we&#8217;re still kind of in the early adopter phase like, Ryan, you&#8217;re an early adopter. You&#8217;re doing everything you think you want to be able to do until it breaks. And, like, I love, like, test it till it fails as a concept of how to get involved in something because, like, you&#8217;re just experimenting, and we encourage experimentation in open source and in open source software and certainly in WordPress. And so, like, it is an unusual thing to think of, like, the best way that I can give back to this project, that I can contribute to this project and make sure that it continues to succeed long term is by using it until the wheels fall off and then tell people what made the wheels fall off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that is a change in thought, But you&#8217;re right. Like, it&#8217;s a very old school open source idea to just get in there and see where it breaks, and tell us. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all we need. And I love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But I just passed my 9-year anniversary being a sponsored contributor, and I was in WordPress for a little bit before it. And so, like, I&#8217;m officially the old guard of us, and so the fact that I&#8217;m, like, so excited about the fact that people are gonna come in and break Mario&#8217;s stuff. Mario, don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s how it works. But also, like, I do find that very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:31] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m willing to see how people break things; that&#8217;s what we need. I totally agree with your reasoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. So I do have kind of, just, like, a final question for y&#8217;all. If there were one thing that you wanted the people who are listening to the WordPress Briefing to know about the Interactivity API, like a hidden gem, a little secret trick. Like, what would it be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] <strong>Mario:</strong> For me, the most exciting part of the Interactivity API is the functionality the client-side navigation enables because there are many, many things there. And I&#8217;m sure that there are many things we haven&#8217;t thought about yet, and the community will come up with some ideas and that would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:17] <strong>Ryan:</strong> For me, the thing is, I love how integrated it is with WordPress, and I know a lot of thought has gone into that without getting too into the weeds. The reasons the decisions that were made were made was so all the hooks and filters and all that goodness that we&#8217;ve had for 20 years is still gonna work. And with the HTML API, the tag processor stuff that&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, it&#8217;s just so cool. It works so well with WordPress. It just works and that&#8217;s probably it for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I work with it, I&#8217;m not having to do any weird janky filtering or stuff that, like, you know, the things that I want to do are not hindered by the Interactivity API. The rather, I&#8217;m able to do more things because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> I prefer Ryan&#8217;s answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:00] <strong>Mario:</strong> It&#8217;s something really important and it&#8217;s something we usually take for granted that it just works with WordPress APIs and the Block Editor, but if you think more about it, it&#8217;s amazing. Like, It&#8217;s what makes it really powerful, I I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For what it&#8217;s worth, I think that&#8217;s true for a lot of, like, the R&amp;D type things that we&#8217;re working on in the project right now. Right? Across Our ecosystem, like WP Playground. It is mind-boggling how progressive that is as a concept, and we currently have, like, you know, 25 ideas about what we could do with it, and we&#8217;re currently working on, like, five because we&#8217;ve got two and a half developers on it or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, like, the expectation that it will just work is there for everybody who has, is not part of the R&amp;D process, but for everyone else who&#8217;s, like, been watching its development over time, shocking. Shocking that it works at all. Not because it wasn&#8217;t supposed to work, but because, like, if someone had asked you five years ago if it was gonna be possible to run WordPress development environments locally and then also just export it and import it into whatever host you want. Like, without a host, without a server, we would all think that you were nuts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:22] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Amazing what&#8217;s happening there and, like, some of the things that we&#8217;re seeing, people who are, like, researching with AI in the WordPress space doing? Equally shocking. All of these things. Like, had you said anything to me about it five years ago, I&#8217;d be like, well, that is a mystery. So, every once in a while, I do have wild ideas about things that I wish we could do with our software. And so yesterday, I went and looked at a prototype for something that someone built based on a wish that I had in 2019. In 2019, I was like, you can play Skyrim on an Amazon Dot using just your voice. So like, why can&#8217;t we build a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then in 2021, someone prototyped that for me. It was ridiculous. It was very bad. It was hilarious. But, also, like, it took 35 minutes to create a &#8216;Hello world&#8217; page, which was ridiculous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, like, what we&#8217;re looking at, the research that I keep seeing from that AI space is people saying, like, I&#8217;m gonna put in a plain text prompt. I need a website as a yoga instructor who also makes custom hats. Right? And then, like, poof. You have this thing that kinda looks like a website with your basic functions and features using the blocks that we have created for WordPress. Like it&#8217;s fascinating how far it&#8217;s come. And that&#8217;s in 2021. It was literally impossible the last time that I was talking about it with anyone, equally literally impossible. Everyone&#8217;s like, plain language prompts for stuff, like that is just a pipe dream. Get away from us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I keep seeing, like, these demos of the research, and it&#8217;s not as far away as we all thought it was. For all these things, Playground, Interactivity API, The AI research is being done. Like, we&#8217;re just a walking R&amp;D group over here in WordPress, and I love it. It&#8217;s fascinating. We&#8217;re just making the impossible possible every day, and I think that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sorry. I got really sidetracked. Do y&#8217;all have anything that you wanted to be sure to share about either the Interactivity API or anything that&#8217;s coming up? Something you wanna make that our listeners know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would just like to emphasize that we love feedback. Please share your feedback. If you test it, yeah, if you think it&#8217;s bad feedback, share it with us as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s especially the feedback we like. I don&#8217;t like this part. That&#8217;s great. We we want to know because the idea is that it serves all purposes for this kind of interactions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That nothing new, but I would like to emphasize that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You know what? There&#8217;s nothing new under the sun. It&#8217;s fine. You&#8217;re good. You should always tell people what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Ryan:</strong> If you&#8217;re interested in getting started with the Interactivity API and just don&#8217;t have any idea where to begin, there&#8217;s actually a pack there. There&#8217;s a Create Block template. So the Create Block package allows you to to quickly scaffold blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a template that&#8217;s part of the Gutenberg repository. It&#8217;s been published on it and NPM. And it will scaffold a very simple block out for you and it&#8217;ll give you, it&#8217;ll show you all the plumbing and how all the pieces work together. So, I think that&#8217;s a fantastic place to get started. It&#8217;s a very simple block. It just basically shows and hides a message, but it&#8217;s all done via the Interactivity API, but it&#8217;s a really, really great sort of, like, like, &#8216;Hello world&#8217; style. I&#8217;m gonna shamelessly self-promote myself at WordCamp Asia. I&#8217;ll be at WordCamp Asia this year doing a workshop where I will be doing some stuff with your Interactivity API. But, if you&#8217;re there and you wanna chat more about the Interactivity API, I am all ears, and I love talking about this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Cool. Ryan, Mario thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a wonderful conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So I hope that you all find that whole project as fascinating as I find it. The Interactivity API is, I know, something that we&#8217;ve kind of been talking about for a while. It showed up specifically in State of the Word, and it&#8217;s hard to understand how important, how vital that work is going to be until you really get your hands on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I recommend you get in there. You take a look at it. I think also Ryan has a few live streams that he does, and he&#8217;s planning on a couple for the Interactivity API coming up. And so just keep an eye out for all of that as we go. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:37] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now that brings us to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, it&#8217;s a bunch of feedback and documentation. So, first things first. Did you know that the Documentation Team holds an online monthly Contributor Day on the fourth Tuesday of every month. It&#8217;s just an online docs day, and I love it. So, the next one that&#8217;s coming up is February 27th. We&#8217;re looking for folks to help. So show up, figure out how to get some docs done, and make the WordPress project easier to follow, one bit of documentation at a time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that I have is a request for feedback. So, we announced in December that we have a new centralized WordPress events landing page on WordPress.org, and we wanted to give more visibility to all kinds of WordPress events across the globe. But as always, we really could use your feedback about what is useful for you, what you had hoped to see, what you didn&#8217;t see. So, leave your comments with any relevant feedback about how you would improve those pages and the text on it. If you&#8217;re missing anything relevant, if there are ideas that you have for what could be there, all ideas are welcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, the third thing that I have on our list today is another documentation thing. So, over the last year, a group of contributors have been working to improve the block development onboarding experience within the Block Editor handbook. That contains over 400 published pages, and the effort in 2023 to kind of overhaul that and make it easier was just the beginning. So, it&#8217;s a daunting task. It&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s complex, but improving documentation is one of the easiest ways to contribute to the WordPress project, especially If there are just quick fixes like typos or formatting. Feedback on the existing content, such as the new block tutorial, is invaluable. And so, if you have not taken a look at those yet, wander over to the show notes, click a link or two, take a look, get some feedback to us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

Identified as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaw, it poses a critical security risk, allowing attackers to potentially gain unauthorized control over websites running on an affected version of Bricks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Bricks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bricksbuilder.io/\">Bricks</a> or Bricks Builder is a visual site builder that allows users to create web pages on WordPress without using code through their drag-and-drop interface. Unlike other similar products in the WordPress ecosystem which deliver functionality through plugins, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/bricks-laying-down-a-foundation-in-the-wordpress-page-builder-market\">Bricks Builder</a> uses the theme functionality as it’s way of delivering features to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding RCE Vulnerabilities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>RCE vulnerabilities are among the most critical types of security flaws. They allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a website from a remote location, allowing them to control the site, access confidential data, distribute malware, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timeline of the Patch</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability disclosure timeline is commendable for its efficiency. The flaw was reported to Bricks by security research team snicco on February 10, 2024, marking the start of a swift and effective response. Bricks acknowledged the issue on the same day and, by February 13, had released the patch (1.9.6.1) following snicco&#8217;s recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Update Highly Recommended</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-themes/bricks/bricks-196-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution#:~:text=The%20Bricks%20theme%20for%20WordPress,execute%20code%20on%20the%20server.\">Wordfence</a> has labelled the severity of this vulnerability a 9.8 out of 10 while <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/database/vulnerability/bricks/wordpress-bricks-theme-1-9-6-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability\">Patchstack</a> has labelled it a 10 out 10, marking it a critical update for website owners using Bricks.

Moving forward, the organization hopes to promote open-source projects and the cause of the open web to legislators around the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of us in WordPress, regulatory oversight is probably a future we can anticipate. If we want to remain competitive in the enterprise/government space, we&#8217;ll need to figure out how to be more proactive at compliance and security and get better at sharing the positive open-source narrative.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The regulatory landscape that the WordPress community finds itself in today is vastly different from where we’ve been. Governments are accelerating their regulatory oversight of technology and introducing new legislation regularly to try and catch up with the pace of innovation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Europe recently we’ve seen two landmark pieces of legislation, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the proposed Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). While both have created news in technology circles it is the CRA that has been <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/concerns-over-the-european-unions-cyber-resilience-act-cra/\">of particular concern to the WordPress community</a> and other open-source projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/08/Open_Letter_on_the_Significance_of_Free_and_Open_Source_Software_in_the_EU_s_Proposed_Cyber_Resilience_Act.pdf\">open letter to EU legislators in July 2023</a>, the leaders of WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and TYPO3 highlighted the risks to open-source and began a collaborative effort called the Inter-CMS Working Group to bring about significant change to the wording proposed in the CRA.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Impact of Collaborative Advocacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In early December, after several months of dialogue, investigation and negotiation, the EU parliament <a href=\"https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-17000-2023-INIT/EN/pdf\">released an updated draft of the legislation</a> that looks to have resolved many of the primary concerns raised by open-source communities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The revised Act makes a concerted effort to ensure that the regulations are practical and do not hinder the collaborative spirit or the ways of working that open-source projects like WordPress rely on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the success of amending the CRA as a foundation to build on, the four open-source communities represented in the Inter-CMS Working Group recently <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupal-association-co-founds-the-open-website-alliance\">established the Open Web Alliance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Alliance, <a href=\"https://typo3.org/fileadmin/t3o_common_storage/documents/press_releases/2024-02_Open_Website_Alliance/Open_Website_Alliance_Charter.pdf\">now formalized with a charter</a>, represents a collective commitment to furthering the education about and advocacy of open-source benefits and principles. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-2 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"1880\" height=\"1253\" src=\"https://149611589.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pexels-photo-2871654.jpeg\" alt=\"Reichstag building in Berlin, Germany.\" class=\"wp-image-153916\" />Photo by Federico Orlandi on <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/white-and-brown-concrete-building-2871654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pexels.com</a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Future of the Open Web Alliance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance aims to promote and defend the rights of open-source projects, aspiring to create a better web. It emphasizes encouraging the use of open-source software, sharing best practices, and supporting third-party open-source projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This collaborative body, while not a legal entity, signifies a structured approach to ensuring open-source software remains a vibrant and integral part of the digital landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, the presence of the Open Web Alliance could be a game-changer in how open-source communities navigate regulatory challenges and advocate for policies that recognize and support the unique nature of open-source development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its charter underscores a commitment to openness, trust, and quality, offering a platform for open-source CMS projects to collaborate more effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition toward a more formalized alliance underscores the WordPress community’s role not just in advocacy, but in shaping a future where open-source principles are acknowledged and protected in the global digital policy arena. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance’s foundation and its charter reflect a mature, strategic approach to ensuring that the ethos of open-source software continues to thrive amidst an evolving regulatory landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Navigating A Regulatory Future: Implications for WordPress Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent developments around the CRA and the active role of the (now) Open Web Alliance highlight a broader trend: the regulatory landscape impacting open-source software is evolving. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For WordPress businesses, the amendments to the CRA represent a momentary sigh of relief, but the horizon suggests that regulatory challenges will persist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a business perspective, the future willingness of enterprises and government entities to adopt open-source software may hinge on how effectively the community can navigate these regulations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Open Web Alliance’s efforts to advocate for open-source principles–emphasizing security, reliability, and openness–become crucial in this context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth considering that the relationship dynamics between government entities, enterprises, and open-source vendors are likely to evolve. A failure to leverage open-source software due to regulatory or compliance concerns could limit innovation and flexibility for governments and businesses alike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the WordPress ecosystem, this underscores the importance of supporting initiatives like the Open Web Alliance, ensuring that open-source software remains a viable, attractive option for all users, regardless of the regulatory climate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing on education, advocacy, and the development of compliance tools, the WordPress community can help mitigate potential reservations from enterprise and government sectors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This proactive stance not only defends the community’s interests but also promotes the fundamental advantages of open-source software in fostering innovation, security, and a more inclusive digital future.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-neutral-100-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>What do you think?

Additionally, a few questions were replaced or updated to ensure the survey captures relevant data on current and future WordPress topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data collected is used as one of many signals that inform the project&#8217;s road map and  areas of focus, both near and long-term.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights from 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, awareness and/or use of block-based features is up year over year, as well as resources such as Learn.WordPress.org. This reflects project-wide efforts to increase utilization of these respectively. However, positive sentiment about WordPress is down modestly, and more so among contributors. The analysis of the annual survey highlights certain areas that could benefit from increased attention in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the highlights split into three parts: logistics, general trends, and contributor sentiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Logistics</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Completions were up 17% in 2023, though short of a goal to double them, despite increased promotion and partnership with some hosting partners.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Polyglots team translated the survey from English into 9 different languages, the most ever for the survey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Debuted a new platform, Alchemer, for improved accessibility, usability, data collection, administration, and analysis.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The completion rate increased again from last year’s high of 63% to 79% in 2023, proving that investing some time in the new platform and clarifying wording was well worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">General trends</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>NPS* was 30.1 overall, with contributors at 27.9 and non-contributors at 32. The NPS has trended downward since 2021, when it was 45. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>60% of respondents indicate usage of Gutenberg, 8% are unsure, and 12% use something other than Gutenberg and/or the Classic Editor. This is up from 2022 (54%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>45% of respondents indicate that the WordPress Site Editor meets their site-building needs, 26% are indifferent, and 29% disagree.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>61% of respondents indicate familiarity with block themes and plugins. While this question was not asked previously, in 2022, 53% said they had used blocks<br />“In the new site editor.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security, performance, and stability were the top three critical areas respondents considered when building their website, plugin, theme, or style variation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>63% agree that WordPress is as good or better than other CMSs, down from 68% in 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents indicated that the best things about WordPress are that it is open source, has ample plugin options, incorporates good customization, is easy to use, and offers flexibility. This is similar to 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limitless configurations, performance, scalability, accessibility, integration, hosting, and support all saw 100% or more increases compared to 2022 regarding favorite things about WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents cited “too many plugins,” “the site editing experience,” “security,” and “performance” as the top four worst things about WordPress. Most interestingly, though, 16% indicated that none of the 20 topics were terrible, and there was a 43% decrease in the number of people indicating that “site editing is difficult to learn.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search engines and YouTube continue to be the two most common resources for finding information about WordPress, while those writing about WordPress, in general, saw a sharp decline year over year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor sentiment</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>58% of self-identified contributors to WordPress said they agree with the project’s roadmap plans for “Phase 3” and “Phase 4” as a good plan to enhance the WordPress experience for developers, creators, and publishers alike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While about one-third of respondents indicated they contribute to the WordPress project, only about half knew how to get involved, knew about WordCamps and meetups, understood the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com, and knew the benefits of open source.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Of 22 topics, the distribution of the top three things that WordPress needs to focus on from the perspective of contributors was broad, with only a 13.5% raw percentage point (1350 basis points) difference between performance (18.6%) in first position and collaborative editing (5.1%) in 22nd position. This shows a need for more consensus among contributors regarding where to focus resources and/or illustrates that the project has many essential elements with passionate supporters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fewer contributors had a positive experience in 2023 (55%) versus 2022 (64%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Similarly, the feeling of being welcome in the WordPress community among contributors decreased to 57% versus 64% in 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furthermore, contributors feel appropriately recognized less in 2023 (46%) than in 2022 (51%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bringing it all together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 annual WordPress survey participation and results highlight the possibility of survey burnout within the WordPress community and some declining overall satisfaction among contributors. There is an opportunity to increase awareness regarding critical initiatives such as WordCamps and other resources for WordPress users and contributors alike and to increase messaging on improvements made within the project to the CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s planned for 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next iteration of the survey, the plan is to improve the survey’s questions further to ensure they continue to provide valuable insight into the project’s trends. This means some questions will be replaced while others might be refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, plans are being explored to distribute and promote the survey at each of the three annual flagship WordCamps (Europe, U.S., and Asia). This would be in contrast to a single yearly survey. More exploration on this topic will take place in the months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2024/02/2023-WordPress-Annual-Survey-Results-Deck.pdf\">View the 2023 Slide Deck</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reporting.alchemer.com/r/738278_655bbaa5598b14.93675163\">View a web-based version of the results.</a> <em>Note that this link may expire in the future.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>*<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/net-promoter-score-calculation\">What is NPS?</a> Simply put, NPS is a KPI organizations can use to measure how likely it’s [users, clients, members] are to recommend a product or service.

You’ll find more ways to manage your fonts and styles, notable upgrades to synced patterns, a collection of Site Editor and performance updates to help you get things done, and new ways to leverage design tools in Classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will include breakthrough foundational APIs that will start to transform how you use blocks to build memorable experiences. This release invites you to dig into these early-stage frameworks, discover how you’d like to see them evolve, and have an impact on their future improvements and capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excited yet? Keep reading for some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet the Font Library</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially slated for release in WordPress 6.4, the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59166\">Font Library</a> is one of those great things worth the wait. It gives you new capabilities for efficiently managing a vital piece of your site’s design—typography—without coding or extra steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Font Library, you can handle fonts across your site regardless of your active theme—much like how you manage assets in the Media Library. You can install local fonts or Google Fonts, and it’s easily extensible, with the ability to add your own custom typography collections.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Synced patterns get an upgrade</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reusable-blocks/\">Synced patterns</a> bring efficiency to the design process, letting you make global changes to particular layouts with minimal effort. However, there’s often a need to make contextual changes when it comes to content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 introduces new enhancements to synced patterns that let you override the content in each specific instance. You can choose what content can be updated within a synced pattern—while maintaining the design and layout you’ve already created. Use it for templated pieces like recipes, testimonials, or case studies that use recurring elements to frame unique content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This major release will introduce overrides for the Paragraph, Image, Heading, and Button blocks, with support for more blocks to come as work on synced patterns continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connecting blocks and custom fields or other dynamic content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 will finally make it possible to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53300#issuecomment-1938463648\">connect core block attributes to custom fields</a>. This capability lets you use the value of a custom field without creating custom blocks. For example, a digital publication could use custom fields with Paragraph and Image blocks. It could pull information from its individual staff writer profiles to dynamically display on its team page, like headshots and names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">Block Bindings API</a> powers this functionality and is designed to be extensible enough for developers to connect blocks to any dynamic content—not just custom fields. If your data is stored elsewhere, you can easily point blocks to that new source with only a few lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first step in a larger project to simplify how custom fields and other dynamic content are managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Interactivity API gets baked into Core</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as just a taste in WordPress 6.4 with the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/51132\">lightbox feature for images</a> is officially making its way into Core. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks\">Interactivity API</a> is a new framework that offers developers a standardized method to bring interactive front-end experiences, or interactions, to blocks. It aims to simplify the process, with less dependencies on external tooling, while maintaining optimal performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interactions create engaging user experiences, whether showing new comments or fetching search results without reloading a page, allowing visitors to interact with content in real time, or incorporating effects like countdowns and transitional animations that surprise and delight. Check out <a href=\"https://wpmovies.dev/\">this demo site to get a taste of what this framework can do</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.5 is just the beginning of bringing this developer experience into Core. Find out how you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56803\">follow along with the work or lend a hand</a> and test more features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get more from your revisions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Revisions are the markers of progress. For creative projects, they&#8217;re also a welcome fallback when you&#8217;re working through a new design or concept. This release brings more detail to your style revision history in the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/01/22/core-editor-improvement-robust-revisions-in-the-site-editor/\">Style revisions in 6.5</a> present a more detailed picture of your work, with design updates like time stamps, quick summaries that outline changes, and the ability to see a full list of revisions made—not just the previous 100. View revisions from the Style Book to see changes that aren&#8217;t reflected in the template you&#8217;re working on. Style revisions are also newly available for templates and template parts, giving you a broader view of your site’s changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect to see more <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/05/revisions/\">work happening to expand and improve revisions across the WordPress experience</a>. It’s a foundational part of the collaborative editing and workflows focus of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Gutenberg project&#8217;s Phase 3</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Classic themes can opt into appearance tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the design experience in Block themes evolves and improves, many of these upgrades are also available for Classic themes. Theme authors can choose to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60118\">add support for appearance tools to any Classic theme</a>—even without the use of theme.json. Opting in gives designers and site creators using Classic themes access to a varied set of design options, from <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/blob/trunk/src/wp-includes/class-wp-theme-json.php#L576\">spacing and border controls to typography and color options</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching themes can feel like a big undertaking, and for folks who aren’t ready to jump into the flexibility of Block themes, these pathways to adoption can help ease that tension. Once a Classic theme gets initial support for appearance tools, more design options will be automatically added as they become available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More design tools are on the way</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each WordPress release brings more thought and attention to the way you can create with the Site Editor. The latest improvements to the design experience help bring your creative vision to life:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/57005\">Background images for Group blocks get size and repeat support</a>, letting you play with subtle or splashy ways to add visual interest to your layouts.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56897\">Aspect ratio support for the Cover block</a> gives you more control over your Cover block images’ shape and size.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57103\">Shadow support added to more blocks</a> to help create layouts with visual depth or add a little personality to your design.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Site Editor updates to streamline your workflow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bring ease and simplicity to your site-building process with the latest advancements to the Site Editor’s capabilities, from important interface improvements to upgraded tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going beyond Group blocks, you can now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/54426\">rename every block in the List View</a>. You can also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55188\">rename</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/55292\">duplicate</a> individual patterns to help keep them organized. Other notable UI improvements add access to your block settings with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50273\">quick right-click from List View</a>, adjust preferences with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/56510\">consolidated settings in the Editor preferences panel</a>, and the ability to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56295\">block toolbar on hover when you’re in Distraction Free mode</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also notice a cleaner and more unified link-building experience that <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/50891\">improves link controls</a>, making it easier to create and manage links in various blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release has a bounty of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33683\">drag-and-drop enhancements</a> to make your editing experience feel more intuitive. You’ll notice helpful visual adjustments, like <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56625\">displaced items in List View</a> when you drag them around to reorganize. You’ll also find that you can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/56070\">drag and drop anywhere you’d like</a> in the Editor, from the very beginning to the end of your workspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Data Views in the Site Editor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every piece of your site comes with a library of information and data. Organizing it, finding what you need, and making informed changes should be as effortless as your site editing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 includes <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/55083\">data views</a> for pages, templates, patterns, and template parts. You can view data in a table or grid view, with a new UI for toggling fields and making bulk changes. It’s a refreshing and feature-rich experience that leads the way for the upcoming <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/12/admin-design/\">Admin Redesign project</a> on the WordPress roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Plugin dependencies improve the plugin experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 improves <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/57545\">how users manage plugins that require other plugins</a>. Plugin authors can supply a new <code>Requires Plugins</code> header with a comma-separated list of required plugin slugs from the WordPress.org Plugins repository, which will present users with links to install and activate those plugins first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Required plugins must remain active and installed for as long as plugins that require them are active and installed. If any required plugins become inactive or uninstalled, the plugins that require them will be automatically deactivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Big performance gains across the editing experience and more</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5 contains more than 110 performance-related updates, including an impressive <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/57935\">increase in speed and efficiency</a> across both the Post Editor and Site Editor. Loading is over two times faster than in 6.4, with input processing speed increasing to nearly four times faster than the previous release. You’ll also find yourself navigating through the Site Editor six times faster than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loading time for translated sites gets a boost due to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">merging Performant Translations into Core</a>. This greatly improves the load time of translated sites across the board by loading multiple locales simultaneously, making switching between them a faster and more enjoyable experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessibility highlights</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring that WordPress remains highly accessible is crucial for its success and fulfilling the mission of democratizing publishing. With this in mind, 6.5 will ship more than 65 updates to improve accessibility throughout the platform. These updates include fixes to contrast settings, cursor focus, submenus, positioning of elements, and more.

Even though I don&#8217;t follow sports, I&#8217;m obsessed with the Super Bowl, and typically host watch parties every year. I love seeing the pinnacle of American achievement. The Super Bowl centers around a number of interesting stories in my life, such as when I was in high school and very poor the Super Bowl was in Houston, and they made McNuggets really cheap, so I ate 104 McNuggets in one sitting. (Sweet and sour sauce, natch.) At that infamous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXVIII_halftime_show_controversy\">Justin Timberlake / Janet Jackson moment</a>, they needed extras on the field to be their audience and my high school girlfriend was one of the kids in the audience when it happened.

This has been a good stress test for the moderation team, we&#8217;ve done a pretty good job keeping up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to see the submitted photos visit <a href=\"https://photos.wpkerala.org/\">https://photos.wpkerala.org/</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-6535_bc820e-8f\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\" /></div></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6535_f27161-0f alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top kb-theme-content-width\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6535_52d065-7c inner-column-1\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading6535_c54615-e0 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><a href=\"https://hallwaychats.com\">WPPhotos.Info</a></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://wpphotos.info/sharks-on-the-sand/\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/40365b3f9f700cfa6.90654423-scaled-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"A group of sharks laying on the sand.\" class=\"wp-image-6538\" /></a></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/author/faisalahammad/\">Faisal Ahammad</a>, shared his story about the WPPhoto of the week:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My four friends and I visited Malaysia and Singapore last September to attend&nbsp;<strong>WordCamp Malaysia 2023</strong>.

So why are tech companies laying off workers?</a> This article has some good data, but I think misses the point with sub-heads like &#8220;Shine has come off the tech industry.&#8221; Really? How is that reflected in their stock prices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a few things are happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, tech companies are typically best at adopting new technology, which leads to productivity gains. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI may be an obvious example of this, though for all its hype it hasn&#8217;t had a huge impact on most companies yet. I agree with Sam Altman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1752753792058294725\">when he says there may someday be a billion-dollar company run by one person</a> who is able to highly leverage future AI agents to automate most traditional roles at a company. That said, I think there are advantages to teams including allowing people to go on vacation or take time off, and provide business continuity and succession, so literally one-person is probably an exaggeration. We don&#8217;t need AI to see very small teams being valued highly: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/13/2946785/facebook-instagram-acquisition\">Instagram had only 13 employees when it sold for a billion dollars to Facebook</a>, in 2012!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of this productivity gains just come from adoption of existing tools like Google Workspace or Office 365, issue trackers and version control with tools like Gitlab, Github, or Jira. At Automattic we don&#8217;t use email to work or communicate internally, it&#8217;s all Slack and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">P2</a>. We also leverage our <a href=\"https://distributed.blog/\">distributed</a> nature to effectively have teams around the world coordinating several shifts of product work per day, and 24/7 coverage for things like systems and customer support without the need for &#8220;graveyard shifts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way tech companies operate, the pace and culture, would be unrecognizable to people at many more traditional companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At tech companies some roles are highly leveraged, like systems, engineering, and design, and everything else in the company really exists to support these. These leveraged roles can create enormous amounts of value, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s not unusual to hear of machine learning engineers working on ads at Google with salaries in the seven figures. (There&#8217;s been a weird accounting thing where companies put a lot of their compensation into equity, but I think that&#8217;s going away as investors are learning to better account for dilution and employees appreciate the fungibility of cash.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creators are also highly leveraged, which is why <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/media/joe-rogan-podcast-spotify-deal-28eb5f74\">Joe Rogan can sign a new $250M deal with Spotify</a> (which smartly puts him back on Youtube) after laying off 1,500 people in December. Some people like <a href=\"https://hagenterschueren.com/\">Hagen Terschüren</a> try to <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@hagen/111863148058114596\">tie this together and say you should avoid Spotify for it</a>, but there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a business becoming more efficient to serve its customers, it&#8217;s the whole point of capitalism. Capitalism is, as Nicholas Stern says (<a href=\"https://a16z.com/its-time-to-build/\">via Marc</a>), the best way to take care of people we don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s no honor in keeping people employed inefficiently, it&#8217;s better for them to find someplace in the market where their talents will be better leveraged for society and themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a bubble in hiring because tech had so much money it tried to throw people at problems. But the unlock in technology can come from a single person, a single insight. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month\">It&#8217;s the mythical man-month</a>. Tech-first companies are going to become leaner and more leveraged. Fewer people are going to create more value for society, in ways that will follow power laws and I think we should investigate things like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income\">Universal Basic Income</a> to provide for all living beings. Technological progress creates abundance, where we have more than what we need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> last year we did not do layoffs, but allowed performance management and natural attrition (voluntary regrettable was 2.9%, non-regrettable 6.8% for us in 2023) to allow our size to shrink down more naturally, on average two people left for every person we hired last year, from a peak of about 2,064 to 1,936 today.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Feb 2024 02:33:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Matt: Joshua Redman on Tiny Desk\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=111326\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://ma.tt/2024/02/joshua-redman-on-tiny-desk/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:985:\"<p>It&#8217;s hard to pick a favorite tenor player, but the GOATs that come to mind are Dexter Gordon, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, Michael Brecker, and I&#8217;m missing people but if I had to pick someone to express the human condition and soul, it would be <a href=\"https://www.joshuaredman.com/\">Joshua Redman</a>.

Sunita&#8217;s journey to academic and professional success, with help from the WordPress community, will inspire many.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-featured-img.jpg?resize=1024%2C640&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita Rai at WordCamp Asia\" class=\"wp-image-16707\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A strong desire to acquire knowledge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools first opened in Sunita’s village in the late 1970s, but most locals, including her parents, had neither the funds nor opportunities to complete their education. Over the years, they realized that an education could open doors for their children. Sunita&#8217;s parents vowed to ensure she received a full education, no matter the costs or hardships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her father worked as a seasonal laborer in India and ensured Sunita and her siblings could go to school with the proper supplies. Her mother cared for everything at home, both the family and the farm. Money was scarce, but determination was abundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To finish high school, Sunita moved in with her aunt in a nearby city. After graduation, she worked as a teacher. One of the biggest challenges was speaking and writing in English, a requirement for her first job teaching at a private English-language school. Her own education had used Nepali as the language of instruction. Fortunately, she enjoyed writing in English and became more fluent with practice. She discovered that she would always want a career where she could continue learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of a demanding teaching schedule, Sunita continued her studies at a college affiliated with Tribhuvan University. She knew that doing both would be difficult, but she wanted to be able to support her family while pursuing ambitious life and career goals. Earning a bachelor’s degree was a hugely motivating achievement that inspired her to begin a master’s degree in sociology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teaching for more than five years had been a full-time commitment, with hours of extra work at home. Preparing lessons, grading assignments, and handling exams made it difficult for her to find the time needed for her own studies. Sunita decided she needed more time for her coursework, so she left her teaching job and sought work that would allow her to focus on her studies while still earning money.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-rai-mardi-base-camp-trekking-nepal-nov2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita at basecamp Trekking Nepal in November 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16709\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From teaching to writing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After an extensive search, Sunita landed a content writing job at a successful WordPress development firm in Nepal. Her salary as a content writer wasn’t high, but it grew steadily over time. She would later gain some supplementary freelance work after presenting at a WordCamp. She was able to help support her family as she grew in her career, and now she could do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I’m fortunate to have had the education that gave me the capacity to aspire, get into a WordPress job, meet people from around the world, and tell my story!</p>\n<cite>Sunita</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Early in her career, especially in her early days with WordPress, Sunita benefited from the support of excellent mentors who played pivotal roles in her career development, nurturing her skills in content writing, SEO, and general confidence. Now, she has mentored other content writers and advocates for mentoring programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/speaker-moment-wrodcampasia2023-sunita-rai.jpg?resize=1024%2C672&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita speaking at WordCamp Asia 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16706\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita has engaged in WordCamps, sharing her wealth of knowledge and experiences. Her first WordCamp was <a href=\"https://nepal.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Nepal 2015</a>, a pivotal moment where she connected with WordPress enthusiasts from various Nepalese and international companies. She experienced a welcoming environment that inspired her to become involved in the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2016\">WordCamp Kathmandu in 2016</a>, Sunita delivered a talk on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/12/01/sunita-rai-seo-copywriting-for-wordpress/\">SEO Copywriting for WordPress</a>, marking a significant milestone in her journey. She later joined a panel discussion titled &#8220;Girls in WordPress – Story, Experience, Opportunity, and Career&#8221; at <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/2018/\">WordCamp Biratnagar 2018</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Sunita helped organize speakers at WordCamp Kathmandu <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2022/\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://kathmandu.wordcamp.org/2023/\">2023</a>, and also spoke outside her home country at <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023\">WordCamp Asia 2023</a> and <a href=\"https://sylhet.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Sylhet, Bangladesh 2023</a>. These events and her <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=sunita%20rai\">talks</a>, helped her grow stronger connections within the global WordPress community and encourage more women speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-wordpress-bangladesh-members.jpg?resize=900%2C675&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with members from the WordPress Bangladesh community\" class=\"wp-image-16711\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Translating WordPress and empowering others</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading and writing in your own language is powerful. For Sunita, translation is crucial in bridging gaps and granting access to those with limited platforms to express and share their passions. When she discovered that she could translate WordPress into Nepali, she joined the many other volunteers on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&#8220;Translating WordPress to Nepali means empowering my people to access the freedom that WordPress provides.&#8221;&nbsp;</h2>\n<cite>Sunita Rai</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/01/sunita-with-3-other-female-organizers-wcktm2023.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Sunita with 3 Female Oganizers WordCamp Kathmandu 2023\" class=\"wp-image-16710\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Sunita emphasizes that coding skills are not a prerequisite for contribution: &#8220;The potential impact you can have on the WordPress community is enormous, across areas from local meetups and WordCamps to testing and translating.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights her own experience as a potential path for others. &#8220;WordPress has had a profound impact on my life&#8230; the freedom to work on my own time, to be financially independent, and to overcome my inferiority complex.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her advice to anyone getting started with WordPress: “Get involved in the WordPress community and contribute as early as possible. By participating, you will better understand the project and its people, so you can advocate WordPress in a better way. It will offer you a sense of satisfaction or meaning as well as success in your career.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these open source contributor stories and grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>, or continue your own WordPress journey at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn.WordPress.org</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sunitarai/\">Sunita Rai&nbsp;</a>for sharing about her adventures in WordPress, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Abha Thakor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nalini Thakor</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webtechpooja/\">Pooja Derashri,</a> <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meher Bala</a>, <em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicholas Garofalo</a>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Chloe Bringmann</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/majaloncar/\">Maja Loncar</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mary Baum</a> for interviews, editorial, images, and reviews.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><img width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

This provides consistency in design across different pieces of content. (…) Additionally, folks would then be able to revisit and modify the design of the recipe pattern without affecting the content in existing instances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In this series of videos, you&#8217;ll see me creating a pattern from the theme&#8217;s patterns, setting the allowed overrides for content parts of the pattern, here heading block, button block und Image block</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I change a few styles of the pattern to make it my own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On three new pages, I use the pattern, change the headline, button text and link and and replace the image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In part three, I change the original synced pattern some more, and the changes are then immediately applied to the copies on those three pages as well. Pretty nifty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s go. <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/playnightly.json\">Use this link to load the WordPress Playground</a>.

A few questions came to my mind. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>How can a developer package patterns with overrides?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How can I modify a theme pattern and not have to duplicate it? I probably can&#8217;t as it has its lock mechanism.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What would a theme developer have to do to create patterns that allow content overrides and update when the theme updates? </li>\n\n\n\n<li>How can I lock down the overrides for content creators?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> also created a stand-alone video on YouTube and invites you to<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazJFdHItTGVXdDV6R3drWGhjX0lqSXdZUW5LQXxBQ3Jtc0tuM01XVmplSEk2Si1KTU1ZaWpTa1lYdFc2NjkyV2pqZ1JBQmZzZl9JVDV1aTNKaFNBdGktd3F5ZlBlUmt2YTVBMzFFQjliUDRCakpzMTVBblFtdi1vUURka0tIak40b1F2T3lnSzRFNV96R1RwbVZrMA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FWordPress%2Fgutenberg%2Fdiscussions%2F57937&v=q53XXJdZXtY\"> join the discussion</a> around how you&#8217;d like to see this feature evolve beyond WordPress 6.5</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><strong>Notes </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the info section of the Pattern list, it still shows &#8220;Fully synced&#8221; (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/58725\">#58725</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I didn&#8217;t succeed in changing the text of the button after I already changed the link.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox has a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how one company managed to pivot towards AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcasts players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Ben Ritner. Ben is the founder of Kadence WP, a company that specializes in developing themes and plugins for WordPress, with a focus on enhancing the front end of websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team have developed a suite of blocks that enable users to do more with the core Gutenberg editor, and in 2021, Kadence was acquired and became part of the StellarWP umbrella brand. Where Ben now serves as part of the senior leadership team. Under StellarWP, there&#8217;s a suite of popular plugins, including Learn Dash, the Events Calendar, and GiveWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Ben provides us with an insight into how the Kadence team managed the integration of AI into their products, shedding light on the impact that it has had on their website building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the challenges of migrating content between systems, as well as delving into the role of AI in content creation and design adaptation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben talks us through what guided their technical innovations to accommodate AI generated content and images. Ben&#8217;s perspective is pretty unique, working for a company he started right through to today, where they have an install base of over 400,000 websites, all of which could potentially make use of AI, but not at the risk of breaking backwards compatibility with their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the importance of integrating marketing and SEO knowledge for effective website development, and how the recent demand for AI might cause freelancers and agencies to think again about the products and services they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the way that the team decides what trends in AI to follow. AI is still new, and it&#8217;s possible that what&#8217;s all the rage today will be superseded at any time. Where does Ben find inspiration for which AI platform to use, and which implementations of AI are dead ends for website builders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the impact of AI in web development and are intrigued by its potential, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Ben Ritner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Ben Ritner. Hello, Ben.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Hey. Nice to be on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, thank you for joining me today. We&#8217;re going to talk today about AI. We&#8217;re also going to talk about Ben&#8217;s history with WordPress and Kadence, which is a product that Ben launched quite a little while ago, but he can tell you all about that. But first, Ben, just so that the audience know who you are, and what your relationship is with WordPress, a moment to give us your potted bio, if that&#8217;s all right. So over to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. So I&#8217;m the founder of Kadence WP, which is a company that develops themes and plugins for WordPress, primarily focused on the front end of your website. So, how do you make that website look good, responsive, fast?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re, you know, kind of in that page builder space, but we&#8217;re doing it from a blocks perspective. So we&#8217;ve got a package of blocks, that enable you to do a lot more with the core Gutenberg editor, than what comes in core. And at this moment, I&#8217;m part of the senior leadership team of StellarWP, which is a umbrella brand that Kadence is under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kadence was acquired in 2021. And so now I&#8217;ve moved in with the Stellar org, and we have a number of popular plugins in our suite, including LearnDash, and the events calendar GiveWP. So, yeah, that&#8217;s me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, great. Thank you so much. We are going to dwell a little bit on AI. In fact, I think the primary focus of this will be to touch on AI, but we&#8217;re going to come at it from different angles. We&#8217;ll talk about the products that you&#8217;ve got, although that may not be the primary focus of what we talk about. But we&#8217;re going to talk a little bit about ethics maybe, or, you know, how AI works, and how it might affect the job market, and whether we&#8217;re doing ourselves out of work in the future, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the first questions I&#8217;ve got for you is surrounding the software that you build. Now, you can go into the details of it if you wish, that&#8217;s absolutely fine. Get into the weeds, and get all technical. I&#8217;m going to encourage users to go to the following url. So it&#8217;s kadencewp.com/wordpress-solutions/kadence-ai. If you want to find that in an easier way, go to WP Tavern, search for this episode, and it&#8217;ll be in the show notes there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But over there you demonstrate how you can create, more or less an entire website. So completely from scratch. You&#8217;ve got a vanilla install of WordPress, you install all the bits and pieces that Kadence requires, and moments later, and I really do mean moments. I think you could probably achieve this in under three, four minutes. You&#8217;ve got yourself a functioning website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m interested to know, why you went down that route? What were the sort of, the things that you were thinking about? Why website building? Why not, oh I don&#8217;t know, just simply block building? I&#8217;m curious to know where you are getting your inspiration from. Because if we rewind the clock two years, nobody was talking about AI in the WordPress space, and those that were, were very prescient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now everybody&#8217;s talking about it. There&#8217;s this landslide of products. And you must feel the commercial pressure to get these things right. So, how do you know? How do you judge that what you are building is the right thing for the company&#8217;s future? As opposed to just, well, guesswork really. Difficult question, but let&#8217;s begin there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, yeah. So I think with Kadence, the decision making comes down to, we were really listening to our user base. And we had a product, we have a product called Kadence Starter Templates. Which is essentially a site that is designed, and has placeholder text, and allows you to import that as you&#8217;re like, I&#8217;m going tolaunch a site quickly. Maybe it&#8217;s in my correct niche, because we had over 80 starter templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe the images are close to something I&#8217;m going to do, or maybe the text is close. But I&#8217;ve got to go in there and edit it, and make it my own. That starting place gets past that white screen of, what do I do, I&#8217;m staring at a white screen, and somehow I need to build a website from this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was immensely popular. We saw all kinds of users using it, from the agencies using it as a, I want to get started quickly on a site, that they had already had designed for, but they wanted to use the starter template because they just wanted it to be built out to where they could edit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we saw, you know, freelancers using it. We saw hobbyists using it. And essentially, when we went in to look at, what&#8217;s the easiest way to implement AI, to make that faster and better for users? How do we make that white screen problem of, I don&#8217;t know what to do next, easier for users? And there&#8217;s a lot of focus right now on prompt based communication with the AI, where it&#8217;s really on, how good are you at writing a prompt to an AI to get stuff back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we kind of just wanted to approach, can we take our starter templates product, and just make the content, the images, and the text, be filled with AI data? Images, we&#8217;re still a ways out from, because AI generated images are pretty poor at this time, and expensive. What we do use, is we use AI to search Pexels, and then pull in images that are in that same vein for what you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a good starting point, but is it a launch site? No. Like, there&#8217;s nothing about our product, or even where we&#8217;re trying to go, where we&#8217;ll say, you can launch and don&#8217;t need to edit. Part of it is because AI is not that good. But there is a sense of, are you 80% there? And that, I think, is really intriguing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think, in our minds, this was step one. Ideally we can get to 90% there. Because I think once AI images gets better, and being able to tell the AI specifically, hey, we&#8217;ve got a hero here, there&#8217;s this text , we want an image for that background, you know, we will get there eventually. But as far as like our decision making into what are we going to build, it really came out of, what are people using and like, and how do we make that experience better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you were in the, well, lucky isn&#8217;t the right word, but you&#8217;re in the enviable position, that you already had the stack of things that really were required. And it was just a case, well, just a case, it was a case of tweaking the things that you already had. So the starter templates, and what have you. And that&#8217;s the decision that you made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s curious, because I&#8217;ve seen quite a lot of commercial products come out of nowhere, and they&#8217;re trying to do exactly the same thing. So in a sense, you had a lot of that stack in place, which must have made it, well, again, I don&#8217;t mean to use the word easy, but it must have made it slightly easier for you to build on top of what you already had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. It definitely made it, it made the story easy to tell. Because I think that&#8217;s part of the issue when you&#8217;re talking about AI is, how do you explain this to your users in a way where you can show them how this is going to benefit, and make their lives easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were also like, we know the problems that come with the current way that we were doing starter templates. Which was essentially, we have a dummy site that actually lives on a server somewhere, and you&#8217;re just copying that to your local site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had thought about, what if we broke this down to be a section by section thing? Where we don&#8217;t actually have a dummy site that lives somewhere. What we have is a library of sections, that can go throughout any kind of pages, and then we&#8217;ll live on your site, put those sections together with content, to build out the pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we took the idea of starter templates and just said, let&#8217;s rechange the technology behind it, so it&#8217;s better and more flexible, and then add in AI generated content and images that can be changed on the fly, and are specific to the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do have some other AI tools built in. What&#8217;s interesting is, you know, we started with, can we get starter templates, and then we backed off. But what we need to do is figure out the sections piece. How do we get AI into sections, and then we pulled that back out to like, okay, now we can do pages and then websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really interesting to think through where we can go with AI. And I think what your original question was getting at is, how do you choose where to go? And we had a path of like, here&#8217;s an easy story, and here&#8217;s how we can implement it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when I think about, where is AI going, what&#8217;s the future, what&#8217;s it going to look like? AI, to me, is a very good tool at doing iterative work. When you ask an AI to improve something, it generally does a pretty good job. And when I&#8217;ve, you know, in my life, and experiencing with using AI tools, the best results usually come from a feedback loop of, it presents you options, and you either choose, I like this one, or you ask for edits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don&#8217;t have a tool that does that very well. We have some inline text options, but it&#8217;s pretty basic. And what&#8217;s interesting for me, just because of using AI for myself, where I feel like our next realm of where we want to go to, is a more iterative thing, because I&#8217;ve seen that AI does a better job when we go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So part of that decision making, of like, where are we going? It&#8217;s based on, I use ChatGPT every day, pretty much. And when I get the best results from it, is when I&#8217;ve said, okay, that&#8217;s close, but edit this, or change this. And I think that iterative approach, if we can bring that into a UI, can be really interesting when we talk about, how do we build very custom and interesting layouts inside of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So our challenge right now is, what does a page wizard look like that&#8217;s iterative, that allows you to say, I want this page to be about this, show me some examples? We show you some examples, and then you choose the one that&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m feeling this, don&#8217;t like that section, I would like more on this, and then generate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, to me, could get really interesting, in terms of like getting you to that 90% of like, this page is 90% there, and I&#8217;m going to go in and tweak some of the text. But yeah, I think that&#8217;s all kind of how we&#8217;re choosing where to go is, trying and playing with the AI ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It almost sounds like you are envisaging a future, in which you have a conversation with a page. So you&#8217;ve got something in front of you, maybe that was generated by something, using your templates. But maybe it was something that you created yourself. And then the AI is somehow in a conversation where you discuss, and you say, I would like the headline to be shorter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, right, give me several options, we&#8217;ve done that. That image is in the wrong place, can we move that round to the other side? And that picture of a cat, replace it with a picture of a lion or, you get the idea. So you are talking, in effect, to the page. Am I describing your intuitions there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:53] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yes. Although I am scared of anything that relies on us to prompt the AI. So, I do want to have that talking, but I want to really focus on, rather than doing too much of, you can just raw text in, because that&#8217;s that same problem with the white page of like, I don&#8217;t know what to ask the AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to do a lot more of, we&#8217;re going to give you options, choose the one you like, and then mini select options inside of that. Or like, where we can guide that to where it&#8217;s really just a bunch of clicks, instead of relying on you to communicate well with an AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The pace of AI is moving so quickly. I really meant it when I said that two years ago, nobody was talking about it. I have no recollection of it being an important subject in the WordPress space. And now it seems to be almost everything that I hear, be it on mainstream media, or in the tech press or in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow AI manages to get itself in there, because everybody&#8217;s so fascinated by it. I just wonder where you get your inspiration from. Now it may be that there are commercial rivals inside of WordPress, you can mention things or not mention things. Or maybe there are things happening in the wider world that, you know, being where you are now in the tech space, and the company that you work for, there&#8217;s probably tendrils that you can use via that company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s just other things that you&#8217;ve seen in the SaaS space, or things that you&#8217;ve watched on television, I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m just curious, because I genuinely feel like the whole thing is a bit of a storm, and you&#8217;re being blown around, and some things seem to be landing, and other things seem to, we have a go and it fits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are telling me that the metrics that you are getting are saying that what you&#8217;ve built is working, which is great. But I can imagine that six months from now, something else will have come along, spun the whole thing around, and you are going to have to get, well, not back to the drawing board, but you might well have to reimagine the things that you&#8217;ve done. So where do you even begin to look for inspiration in this space?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:42] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting. I think there is always a fear that someone will come and top you, in such a way that will make you irrelevant. I&#8217;m not worried about that personally, but I get it, and I definitely know that it exists. I think there&#8217;s a lot more involved in like someone just being able to come and trump you that hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We announced Kadence AI last March, and it&#8217;s honestly annoying to me that it wasn&#8217;t until January of this year that we officially launched it publicly. We had a beta version last summer. So we&#8217;ve had our cards on the table for a long time of like, this is what we&#8217;re building and this is how it&#8217;s going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know that there&#8217;s other plugins and products that have done other things, I mean, Jetpack itself released an AI. And that does a lot of inline, you know, editing great for bloggers, where you want to generate content. I know that there&#8217;s other WordPress AI generated page builders, ZipWP is one. Great product in their approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that there&#8217;s definitely different ways to go about it. And for us, we put our cards on the table last March, we had to get that done. And the trickiest parts were getting the AI to consistently respond, in a format that allowed us to input that into the content that we had. And then trial and error, and things like that really came into play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another big piece for us, which was kind of annoying, we had to spend so much time on it, but we have a large user base. And we needed to create a credit system for our licenses, that allowed us to give everyone access to this tool, but also protect ourselves, because every time this communication happens with OpenAI, it costs us money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was an annoying, massive overhaul of a product licensing system, that had to have backward compatibility, and be implemented across our product line. And that delayed AI by several months, frustratingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, as far as like choosing where to go from here, we have a channel at work that&#8217;s like AI stuff. Essentially, someone in our org is posting in there every single day with, have you seen this tool? Have you seen this tool? I mean, I&#8217;m curious. I&#8217;m all in on, I&#8217;m watching the videos, what are they doing? I&#8217;m really interested. I want to know what people are doing, and how they&#8217;re thinking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I&#8217;m also using ChatGPT everyday, because I want to make sure that I&#8217;m really staying engaged with it, and then allowing myself to think, how do I improve upon what we have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think is a lot different than like, what if you had a blank slate? You had no customer base, and you&#8217;re trying to create a product that&#8217;s unique. That&#8217;s a little bit harder to do versus like, here we have 400,000 active installs with Kadence blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do these customers need, and how do I give them the tools? And, how does AI benefit them? And to me, AI is a tool, it is not a solution. And I think that that&#8217;s really important in my mind, in terms of thinking of, how can I use AI, and how can I bring AI into the Kadence world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of interesting. Over the last few years, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that you, or Kadence, we could use those interchangeably perhaps, have achieved, and I&#8217;m doing air quotes, success. You know, three years ago, I suspect the install base was almost nowhere near the number that you just quoted at us. And it&#8217;s been a real rise. So congratulations for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was something that I was going to ask you about, whether or not that growth forces you to put the brakes on a little bit? In the sense that, you know, you&#8217;ve got this existing user base, you can&#8217;t possibly ship something which breaks 400,000 plus websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, you have to get their buy-in, in a way. And I know that they&#8217;re your customers, but they&#8217;re also the people that you need. And so if you do something shockingly different all of a sudden, we know how that goes. That typically doesn&#8217;t go well. So just an intuition as to whether or not you can&#8217;t be quite as nimble as you would like to be, or if there&#8217;s the breaks that you&#8217;ve got to put on. Do you have to be ultra cautious? Difficult question, and maybe one that you&#8217;re not willing to answer, but i&#8217;ll throw it out there anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:33] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. I would say that the speed of development has changed, because we have improved our systems. Which, on one hand, slows us down a little bit more, in terms of some of the rapid releases I was doing early on, when it was like me and no one else, or like me and my sister and a support person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve definitely slowed down from some of that, but we&#8217;ve also done a lot less hot fixes, and bug fixes, because we&#8217;ve implemented more QA and testing. You know, obviously like we&#8217;ve helped that system a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve also done a lot of stuff, and Kadence over the years, that has improved the code quality, and the structure of the code significantly. But backward compatibility is really tricky, and there are lots of times in a developer&#8217;s life, man, this would be so much easier if we could just start from scratch. Because so much changes, and Kadence Blocks was built originally before Gutenberg was part of Core. We released it in September, and it became part of Core in December of 20 or 2019, 2018. Gosh, I can&#8217;t even remember the year that Gutenberg became part of Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we&#8217;ve rewritten product multiple times, to try to keep it up to date, and it&#8217;s always a challenge. And that backward compatibility is always a challenge. And just even, I mean, when we originally wrote it, Grid CSS and Flex CSS were not fully supported as like things that you could use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so like, just even the structure of our blocks were so different, because we couldn&#8217;t rely on some of this new CSS, and that challenge is real. And that desire to just, give me a clean slate from a developer. Every developer will tell you, they would love that iterative, fixing of older code is so hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s the hard work. And that has slowed us down, certainly it has slowed us down. But I&#8217;m also really proud of that work, because we&#8217;ve really fought to do as much as we possibly can to keep backward compatibility, and to continue to improve the code base, so that we&#8217;re thinking future. And so yes, you know, we&#8217;ve had a lot of success, and things have changed for me and, you know, my day-to-day in a large part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what&#8217;s causing the slowdown is not necessarily that we&#8217;ve been successful, as much as all the other things that come into play, when you talk about a product that&#8217;s been around for more than a couple years. And that&#8217;s the, we got to do a major revamp on this code base, and we&#8217;ve got to prepare all these blocks for what we&#8217;re doing in Gutenberg today versus, you know, four years ago, that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Prior to the whole advent of AI and all of that, did you have a roadmap which looked really different than what it is now? Because I don&#8217;t build software, but I can imagine that if I did build software, I&#8217;d want to be staring into the future as far as I could go. I would want that roadmap to be, you know, agile, but at least have some North Star to be heading towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering, if AI kind of upended that, it was more of a case of, oh okay, there&#8217;s this, right. Throw all that away. Did any of that happen? Did you have to sort of retool the team, or take new people on, or just, like I say, throw away the old roadmap and begin again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:33] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Roadmap for me, or generally like Kadence, is usually not too much more than six months out. Mostly because we learn a lot from our users. The users determine the roadmap more than any other factor, and we&#8217;re continuously updating what we&#8217;re going to be working on in six months, because things change and WordPress changes. So it&#8217;s not as long term as you might think. Like, I don&#8217;t know what Kadence will be developing next January. I have some ideas, certainly. Some back of the mind thoughts, but nothing that we have committed to or decided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the main shift that happened for us is ChatGPT came out, and within a month we were like, we&#8217;re not building starter templates anymore. And that was the big shift. We were kicking out starter templates, at least two a month, of these, you know, niche sites. And we just decided then to pull the plug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were like, the future is going to be AI generated starter templates. We have to solve that problem. Let&#8217;s stop spending any resources that we can, on the old way of, it&#8217;s old and we just had released them, right? But like that old way of thinking. And that was, what did AI do in terms of shifting our mindset? It was like, we&#8217;ve got to put everything into getting AI starter templates out the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, because I&#8217;m part of Stellar, we didn&#8217;t have to go to the Kadence dev team, and I&#8217;m one of them, right? And say, you guys who are working on all this stuff that we were doing, we were working on some major dynamic content stuff, some advanced query block stuff, big rewrite of Kadence blocks. We didn&#8217;t have to go to that team and say, everybody stop what you&#8217;re doing, we&#8217;re doing AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were able to pull resources from our parent company, and that was the team. We formed a whole new team to say, let&#8217;s see if we can solve the AI problem. Which I was a part of, but I wasn&#8217;t the entirety of that team. And so I spent the last year, half on Kadence and half on AI. And that&#8217;s probably not accurate time, but like basically I&#8217;ve been on two teams. Then I got our Kadence team involved, as we integrated the AI stuff we had done into Kadence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how we were able to do that, is we were able to think, okay, we have a use case for how Kadence is going to use AI. But from a Stellar level, all of our products could benefit. LearnDash, for example, has already implemented AI into it. You can get a course outline done using AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we went and developed backend tools, and a server that does all the proxy communication with OpenAI, and all the caching, and all of that licensing piece. That was work that a different team, not the Kadence dev team did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it really helped in us being able to keep releasing things with Kadence theme, and Kadence blocks all of last year, while there was another team working on this whole AI piece. And then towards the end of last year, we spent that time integrating it really into, well, I mean we&#8217;ve been doing it the whole time. We had a beta version out last summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you know, that work then bringing in more of the Kadence dev team, and support team, and all of that to kind of get it out the door. That came at the end where it&#8217;s like, when we announced, hey, we&#8217;re going to do AI, there was a lot of fear that, well, what about your roadmap? What about you guys developing this or that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that was the feedback we were getting, is everyone was very concerned, hey, AI seems like it could be a fad. And we were like, no, hold on, we&#8217;re still doing that. We were just fortunate enough to be able to have resources from outside of our brand, come in and work on a lot of the AI stuff. And so that helped a lot with the roadmap. But obviously the starter templates piece was a shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s really nice that in the background you&#8217;ve got a bigger company, and the AI piece, a lot of the technologies, there&#8217;ll be a lot of commonality there. And so if you build that backend, like you say, the tooling that you need for LearnDash, and all of the different bits and pieces that make up the StellarWP Suite. And you can all share in the benefits of all of that rather than, I don&#8217;t know, five or six different companies all trying to achieve the same thing. So the economies of scale work really well there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty brave decision though, I&#8217;ve got to say, because I think, if you were to go back four or five years, everybody was, do you remember NFTs and Crypto and all that? There was that same euphoria, and it was going to be the future. And I think there&#8217;s quite a lot of people who down tools, and just moved in that direction. And fast forward to today, that now looks like it was a mistake. I think we can probably consign that to the dustbin of history. Perhaps I&#8217;m wrong about that, but it feels like that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And intuitions a couple of years ago about, let&#8217;s throw everything at AI, that could have gone the same way. It didn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think it did. It really doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to go that way. It looks like it&#8217;s going to continue into, you know, for the next decade or however. Again, I could be wrong about that. But it&#8217;s a brave decision for you, the company to make. And it looks like you&#8217;re on the right side of history, so it&#8217;s a sigh of relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:22] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I think the fact that NFTs, so many people were like, what is this, and how does it work, and all of that? It&#8217;s part of the reason why you could get on board with AI a lot easier, because everybody could open up ChatGPT and go, oh wow, this isn&#8217;t the annoying Verizon Wireless, or whatever, large company chat bot that I get at support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very different and improved. And I think that&#8217;s part of why it wasn&#8217;t easy to be like, this could be implemented and used, and be very useful. And I would say we did the bare minimum of, we&#8217;re doing text replacement on layouts. The future of having an AI do more creative, and I&#8217;m using air quotes when I say creative, work with you, is going to be really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I think that it&#8217;s a phenomenal tool to work with you. Like, as far as you being able to guide it, influence it. I think it&#8217;s going to take a lot of the time consuming, exhausting work of making this all look exactly right out, which is going to be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I am going to get into the nuts and the bolts of the actual stuff that you&#8217;ve built over at Kadence. I dropped a URL at the beginning. It&#8217;ll be in the show notes. If you go over to there, you&#8217;re going to find a video right at the top of the page. Caveat emptor. I don&#8217;t know if that will be there in the days, weeks, or months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a video. It&#8217;s a few minutes long. I think it&#8217;s you, Ben, it sounds like you. And you are running through the process of basically building a WordPress website from scratch. And I&#8217;m going to paraphrase it, and if I miss a step out here, forgive me, but I&#8217;ll just, for the sake of brevity, I&#8217;ll just paraphrase it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, you begin this wizard, and you enter some basic details. Details about your company. You describe the business, it spits back at you some possible keywords, and you select those. Once you&#8217;ve done that, you do what you often do with AI, you pick a tone, you know, this sort of feeling of how you wish the website to be. And then you go into the image selection process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then all of that gets consumed by the AI. It has a think for, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the right word. It does what it does. And then it brings back some layouts for you. And you&#8217;ve got this selection of layouts, and your intuition says, that&#8217;s the one. So you pick that. You then start adjusting colors, and it disallows, or at least it prompts you that that&#8217;s not going to be a good selection, in terms of accessibility, which is nice, thank you for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you mess around with the fonts a little bit, and you import some pages that you wish, that you think would be appropriate. So you&#8217;re nearly there. You, at that point, launch the site, if you wish. All the pages get imported, and your site is ready to be launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you&#8217;re into the process of tweaking it, and making it your own. I think anybody using AI would advise you to do. Edit with the block editor, go in, use the AI to amend things if you wish, or just do it yourself. And then you can begin the process of saying, actually, this row is just way off message. Let&#8217;s just swap that one out, and just pick a different one. And again, the AI can step in and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that took me longer to say than it takes to do, I suspect. That is pretty incredible. And it&#8217;s leveraging all the different bits and pieces that you mentioned earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this in any way bound to the products that you release? So I know that you&#8217;ve got a theme. I know that you&#8217;ve got a block suite, and there&#8217;s a pro version of that block suite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having played with it myself, I can see that you&#8217;ve definitely used the blocks that are at your disposal. But, how does that work if I don&#8217;t have access to your pro suite? Would I even be able to use this? Is this available? Is there any kind of free plan? Can I just pay for the AI bit? And what if I decide that I want to back away from it and, I don&#8217;t know, amend things? Is there any lock in, is essentially what I&#8217;m saying?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:59] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Certainly. There is a free tool. Kadence Blocks is free, and Kadence Theme is free, and Kadence Starter Templates is free. You can get a free account to use AI. You&#8217;ll get 250 credits, which is more than enough to build a website. You could build a couple with that many credits. And so if you&#8217;re using free, you will have slightly limited choices into which layout you can choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you get to the point where you&#8217;re shown layouts, we&#8217;re going to give you, let&#8217;s call it six. Two of those will be pro only. And that means that when we design those layouts, they&#8217;re actually using pro blocks that we have. And so if you imported them, it wouldn&#8217;t work, because you don&#8217;t have pro, so you can&#8217;t access those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use one of the free layouts, which I&#8217;ve already looked at one of our, you know, our more popular one is a free one right now. You can do the whole thing for free. And you don&#8217;t have any cost to you. You can go and try it out. We have a way for you to try it out in InstaWP as well. And that&#8217;s free. So if you just want to like play around, that is on our site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as content lock, and this goes into a really interesting conversation of, how avoidable is content lock in WordPress, and in websites in general? And, how do we get away from that? Because the blocks are part of the core editor, if you delete Kadence blocks from your website, the HTML markup will still exist on your website, because it&#8217;s just block markup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the rendering of those blocks won&#8217;t function, because they depend on Kadence blocks to be rendered. And that&#8217;s how all custom blocks work in WordPress, is that if you have a custom block, you need that code to essentially handle the rendering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is work, and we&#8217;re scoping some of this out. There is work, and Matt Mullenweg talked about this State of the Word, to do more data liberation. Where you could say, I&#8217;m using Kadence Blocks, but I want to convert this to Core Blocks, or I&#8217;m using Spectra Blocks, and I want this to convert to Kadence Blocks, or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue with that, is that there is almost never a one for one with any of these tools. Elementor to Kadence, Elementor to Core. All of these kinds of ideas of being able to migrate out of one system into another is fine, if what you&#8217;re trying to get is the text and images. Not fine, if what you&#8217;re trying to get is a one for one of this to that, because Kadence Blocks wouldn&#8217;t exist if we didn&#8217;t massively expound upon what&#8217;s in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one would use it, if it didn&#8217;t take it a whole lot further. And so to convert these blocks to core blocks, you will lose functionality. You will lose the ability to have the accordions, and the tabs, and the sliders, and the certain types of image overlays and animations, and all of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, is there content lock? Yes. There&#8217;s content lock with core blocks as well. If you want to take core blocks to the classic editor, that doesn&#8217;t really work. So it all depends on what your definition of content lock is, and whether or not you feel like this is the system that&#8217;s going to be around for a while, and supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think, when you look at Kadence, we&#8217;re backed by a much larger company. There&#8217;s a lot of longevity in using Kadence Blocks, in terms of being able to render out those blocks for you, and the focus on backward compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do I think data liberation is really interesting? Absolutely. I think where I think about data liberation is, how do we get, and this is what AI, I think, could be really good at. How do we get out of the mindset of, can I move from HTML to WordPress, or Wix to WordPress, or Core Blocks to Kadence Blocks, or Elementor to Beaver Builder, or whatever it is that you want to move?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we stop thinking about tools and go, you have a website, it&#8217;s HTML and JavaScript? Can we train an AI to convert that to some kind of standardised information? Where it basically says, here&#8217;s the JSON markup of this site. This is the type of content it is. Everyone builds importers for that type of thing, so you could say, I want this site in Kadence Blocks. And we use AI to convert that site into some kind of standardised markup that says, here&#8217;s all the content, the type of content, the context for how that content is. And then Kadence Blocks is an importer for that, or WordPress Core has an importer for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That wouldn&#8217;t still be a one for one, because, again, there&#8217;s just no way you&#8217;re going to get a one for one, unless you convert straight to HTML. You could move it, but you wouldn&#8217;t actually be able to use it down the road. But what could be really interesting is, if you could then import that markup into whatever tool of your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it might not be a one for one in design, but in terms of actually usable, and now those blocks will render, and are editable, and you can tweak the styling. And you&#8217;re that much closer. That to me is really, really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s part of the exploration for us is, can we create a system that exports? You know, where we think about grabbing the front end content, getting that into some kind of standardised system, importing that, and then exporting that in and out of that standardised system. I think that there&#8217;s a lot of really interesting stuff, in terms of just being able to process that and say, could this be a thing that we work toward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would take a lot of resources and energy, but would solve all of the weird platform specific stuff. Today what you need is a Wix to WordPress thing. Okay, like I totally get that. But I think down the road as AI gets a lot better at scraping sites, and understanding context, and being able to create, say, hey, this is an area that has media and text, that are related to each other. And we could conceive of a way of like, here&#8217;s all of the way that AI&#8217;s going to convert that content into a standardised format. And that could be really interesting for data liberation of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s absolutely fascinating. The data liberation thing, really is about CMS to CMS at the moment, isn&#8217;t it? You know, it&#8217;s Shopify to WooCommerce and it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, Joomla to WordPress, or whatever it may be. But that more granular piece of, could I come from, let&#8217;s say Joomla, through WordPress, and the tools that I&#8217;m using inside of WordPress, that&#8217;s Kadence. So, can we go that extra step? Not just import it into Core Blocks, but can we then go a little bit further, because I&#8217;ve invested in Kadence, I know what I&#8217;m doing over there. Let&#8217;s give that a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, that&#8217;s really fascinating. And obviously, in everybody&#8217;s interest, if there&#8217;s some standardised way of doing that, and everybody could jump on board, so even your commercial rivals. You could access it, then the import isn&#8217;t the problem, it&#8217;s the quality of the product that is the reason why people would wish to import it. Yeah, that&#8217;s a really interesting idea, and not one that I thought of, the data liberation thing. Yeah, we&#8217;ll see how that goes in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the AI, the way that I deployed it was into a vanilla site, to test out what you&#8217;d got. Also I noticed, I could be wrong about this, but on the video that you posted on the website, it felt like that was a vanilla site. How does the AI work if, because most people are not starting from scratch, are they? A lot of the audience listening to this, will wish to try things out on sites that they&#8217;ve already got, and push the boundaries of pages that they&#8217;ve already got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I know that the blocks themselves, they can be adapted. You&#8217;ve got a bit in the, you know, the bar that appears when you interact with Gutenberg. There&#8217;s something in there which you can interact with the AI and prompt it, and what have you. But does the whole wizard that we described earlier, is there any utility in that, if you&#8217;ve already got a site? Or, is it just for beginning blank slate stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:22] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> So that Wizard, you don&#8217;t need to generate a website, although you can, and you can import that into an existing site, if you want to. That&#8217;s totally fine. But Gutenberg, we have what&#8217;s called a design library. And if you have Kadence Blocks installed, you&#8217;ll see the design library tab in the backend, like in a page editing thing at the top bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you open that up, we can generate contextual stuff, using that same information from the wizard. So if you are building a page, for example, and you&#8217;re like, I need a call to action section, that&#8217;s a context that we&#8217;ve created. You can go in and say, I want all of your sections with call to action context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the AI generated text that is for your website, about call to action. And then you can pick from the layouts. And there&#8217;s hundreds, we have over 600 different patterns in that design library. And all of those can be empowered by AI, and many of them can be used multiple times. So you might see a pattern and say, well, that&#8217;s a great pattern, that I like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can put about context into it, or I can put value proposition context into it, or call to action context into it. So you can choose the context, and then you can choose the pattern type, and then you can drop that pattern into your website. So if you have an existing website and you&#8217;re like, I even have an existing page, and I just want a section, AI can help you there. Or if you&#8217;re building a new page, and you want to piece together patterns, there&#8217;s a lot of different ways that you can use that tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you can go back through and kind of retrofit, and just swap things out. And presumably, rows and patterns kind of used interchangeably there. You can just save those, put them somewhere else for later keeping. But the idea is that you can put these different contexts in, so that you can modify the things that you&#8217;ve got. Okay, that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the stack that&#8217;s in the background? I mean, I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s OpenAI, because everybody seems to be using OpenAI. Are you keeping an open mind about OpenAI? Now there&#8217;s a phrase I should coin. Because it does seem like hot on the heels of OpenAI, you know, they really were first to market with this interactive chat like capability. Which is very beguiling, but it does seem like hot on the heels are Anthropic and Google, with all of their offerings. Are you wedded to OpenAI, well, first of all, is it OpenAI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:32] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> It is open AI, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And second of all, are you wedded to that, or do you keep exploring the different models? Because it does feel, in certain contexts, that OpenAI might be feeling the pressure, let&#8217;s say. I&#8217;ve tried a few different ones out, and in a variety of different contexts, OpenAI excels. In a few, very niche contexts, there are some rivals, which absolutely, you know, they just seem to do a much better job. So anyway, I&#8217;ll just hand that one over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:57] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, for sure. I think we are very much open-minded, in terms of what we do. Part of us building this whole proxy server to handle, and this whole prompt database, and the way that we communicate with OpenAI. The whole time we were thinking, this structure, all that we&#8217;re doing, if we need to switch to some other system. Because OpenAI changes their prices, or they discontinue doing what we&#8217;re using the for, or for whatever reason, we need to make sure it&#8217;s movable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have experimented with Google&#8217;s, and right now we&#8217;re using OpenAI. But in a year from now, we might not be. And I think that was a key part for us of, like we need to make sure that we have the ability to shift and move, if we&#8217;re seeing a new company come up that is significantly better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, you never know. Maybe there&#8217;s somebody who&#8217;s developing something which is really adjacent to the web design industry, and an AI which is specifically for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what you&#8217;ve built, this conduit between the website and the AI. You&#8217;ve built this middleware, which sits in between. And that middleware could just be repurposed at a moment&#8217;s notice, to talk to the, I don&#8217;t know, the Gemini or Anthropic API. And so, really, you wouldn&#8217;t have much disruption to service. Ah, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:08] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> We&#8217;ve got that server in two different places, so we can experiment too. So we can experiment by just locally pinging saying, hey, use the backup server, and then, let&#8217;s experiment with that. So we have a lot of ability to do things, to test things, without disrupting our user base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that there was some sort of credit system, whereby you acquire credits, which then you spend, in order to do the transactions with the AI. How does that work? Is that like a monthly thing that you add on top? Is that a subscription service on top, or do you get a certain package when you purchase it? Just run us through how that works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you mentioned that 250 credits was available on the free version. You also mentioned that that would probably get you through the process of building a couple of websites. So yeah, just talk us through the typical spend on doing things, and how the credit system works, and how do you top things up if you&#8217;re an agency, and a blowing through your credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:59] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Yeah, so we aren&#8217;t charging anything extra for the credits. They come with whatever you have. So if you&#8217;ve purchased from us, you get credits automatically into your account. And if you have an existing purchase, and if you go and purchase today, our pro products have a certain amount of credit. So Kadence Blocks Pro alone is 1200. If you go up to our essential bundle, which is Kadence Blocks Pro and Theme Pro and Starter Templates Pro, that is going to give you 4,000 credits, and then up from that is 8,000 credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We largely created the credits as a deterrent to prevent abuse, not as a system to sell you something more. And our goal is that you don&#8217;t need a separate subscription. And we want to make it so easy to use, or you&#8217;re not really worried too much about your credit count. To that point we&#8217;re talking about single lifetime credit bundle packages, that you&#8217;ll be able to buy for that agency, that&#8217;s burning through their credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going tomake that very, very cost effective. Because, again, we didn&#8217;t ever consider that credits could ever be a revenue driver. We have no plan for it to be a revenue driver. We literally just want to protect ourself on cost. So going forward, there&#8217;ll be some way to buy credits very cheap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole communication and stuff with OpenAI is relatively cheap. That&#8217;s part of the reason why it&#8217;s so usable, so many people are building on it, is because being able to communicate with the AI is cheap. When you take it out to a scale of 400,000 active installs, and things like that, you start to go, oh wow, this could get expensive pretty quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s where, you know, we need to limit some of that. But in general, the idea is that we give you more than enough credits. And if you are an agency, or you&#8217;re burning through a lot of credits, we&#8217;re going to make it very cheap for you to buy more. Current plan right now is a $20 package that&#8217;s going to have like 4,000 extra credits. So we&#8217;re going to make it really simple for you to just say like, oh, top me up, I need more credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just, before we wind it up, let&#8217;s close the lid on Kadence itself. And let&#8217;s just talk about your intuitions, Ben, about AI in general. Now, I&#8217;m not trying to force you to say anything here or to, you know, imply that you&#8217;ve got a certain opinion. But I&#8217;m curious as to what you think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s two phrases that I&#8217;m just going to raise, and one is that, you know, a rising tide carries all boats. In other words, we throw AI into the mix, and everybody&#8217;s experience of life, and website building, and all of that, just becomes better. And then there&#8217;s another phrase which is, just a race to the bottom, which is entirely the opposite, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m just wondering if you have any intuitions about that. Because, certainly amongst the people that I&#8217;ve met, who are jobing website developers, you know, they&#8217;re using tools, much like you&#8217;ve got, and rivals, to build websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is this sort of impending sense of fear amongst some of them, that the very tools which seem so beguiling at the moment, and seem so brilliant because they save a bit of time here, you know, save a minute there, and an hour there and what have you. That all is great, except that there&#8217;s this fear that maybe these tools are going to hollow out the very industry that we&#8217;re serving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the point where, well, in a few years time, you&#8217;ll just go to some webpage and tell it, I want a website to market my cat food, off you go. And, you know, three minutes later you&#8217;re done, and it&#8217;s all finished. So I wonder if you&#8217;ve been thinking about that, if you&#8217;ve got any guardrails in place, or intuitions there. I know that&#8217;s a fairly ephemeral question, it&#8217;s hard to get your hands on. But just a few minutes on your thoughts around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:15] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> Sure. I think, if you are a freelancer who&#8217;s building brochure websites, and not offering anything else, other than, here&#8217;s your website, that would be a concern. I think that&#8217;s a valid concern of like, will these customers keep coming to me, for this very simple brochure website, if that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m offering?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that that&#8217;s been going away for a while, and that freelancers, if you&#8217;re paying attention, you&#8217;re probably already looking at, how can I help people have an effective website, not just a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that there was a time where everyone was like, I just need a website. There&#8217;s just so many local businesses that were like, I just need a website. I think we&#8217;re coming to the end of that time, and most businesses are not just saying, I need a brochure website. They&#8217;re saying, I need a website that helps me do business, even these local companies. That is able to capture on SEO, that&#8217;s able to adequately supply a convincing marketing message for someone to choose them over their competition. That represents them well online, and that allows them to be effective, and continue to serve their local communities, or broader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to me, I think if you&#8217;re a freelancer, you should be really thinking about and learning about marketing. And really thinking and learning about SEO. Because what you want to be able to offer is, yeah, this might look like a brochure website, but let me show you how it&#8217;s actually effective. Let me show you how we positioned your marketing messaging to make it effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are running the ability to do social media ads, and everything else. Like, there&#8217;s just so much more that most businesses need, most anyone who&#8217;s going to be online. I feel like, if all you&#8217;re offering is a brochure site, and done and move on, that is at risk. Because I do think that AI can create a very basic brochure site, that someone will be able to say, that&#8217;s good enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s what the majority of, especially WordPress freelancers, are really trying to pitch someone on. And I think that you just need to make sure that you are continuing to grow yourself. To say, I understand the web, the intricacies of marketing, and SEO. And I can help you, not just to make a good looking website that has your content, but make it so it&#8217;s actually something that people will be able to find, and that&#8217;s going to actually grow your business, or improve your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t think AI is going to be able to solve that. I think tools will help you solve for that. But I don&#8217;t think AI, on its own, or anything automated like that, is just going to be able to solve for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting. I think the only thing that I know that AI will do in the future, is be an agent of change. Whatever that change is, it&#8217;s more or less a question of just putting my finger in the air and guessing, I&#8217;m not really sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s fascinating to get your perspective on it, because a lot of the people that I talk to are those freelancers, they&#8217;re the people building websites. And interesting to get a different perspective. A company that&#8217;s building the tools to enable those freelancers to do the work, and all of the concerns, and thought that you are putting into building out those tools. Really fascinating conversation, I enjoyed that tremendously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before we call it a day, Ben, I&#8217;m wondering if you wouldn&#8217;t mind just sharing some of the places, or place, where people could get in touch with you, if they wish to. I will drop the URL, like I said, of the Kadence website. So if there&#8217;s anything aside from that, just let us know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:49:36] <strong>Ben Ritner:</strong> I&#8217;m not super active on social media, but best place would be our Kadence Facebook group. That is the one place on social media I will come in and out of. I&#8217;m not a huge social media person, but that&#8217;s one that I, that community is super fun, and I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will find a lot of very engaged people in there. So you can go in there and ping me in there. And that&#8217;s probably your best, outside of, obviously you can come to the Kadence website, and just click on our support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:50:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Great. Thank you so much, Ben. It was really a pleasure chatting to you today, all about Kadence, but also about AI. Really appreciate it. Thanks so much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Ben Ritner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben is the founder of <a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/\">Kadence WP</a>, a company that specialises in developing themes and plugins for WordPress, with a focus on enhancing the front end of websites. The team have developed a suite of blocks that enable users to do more with the core Gutenberg editor, and in 2021 Kadence was acquired and became part of the StellarWP umbrella brand, where Ben now serves as part of the senior leadership team. Under StellarWP, there’s a suite of popular plugins, including LearnDash, the Events Calendar, and GiveWP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Ben provides us with an insight into how the Kadence team managed the integration of AI into their products, shedding light on the impact it has had on their website building process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the challenges of migrating content between systems, as well as delving into the role of AI in content creation and design adaptation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben talks us through what guided their technical innovations to accommodate AI-generated content and images. Ben’s perspective is pretty unique, working for a company he started, right through to today where they have an install base of over 400,000 websites, all of which could potentially make use of AI, but not at the risk of breaking backwards compatibility with their own products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about the importance of integrating marketing and SEO knowledge for effective website development, and how the recent demand for AI might cause freelancers and agencies to think again about the products and services they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the way that the team decides what trends in AI to follow; AI is still new, and it’s possible that what’s all the rage today might be superseded at any time. Where does Ben find inspiration for which AI platform to use, and which implementations of AI are dead ends for website builders?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in the impact of AI in web development and are intrigued by its potential, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/wordpress-solutions/kadence-ai/\">Next level site creation with AI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://zipwp.com/\">ZipWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.learndash.com/\">LearnDash</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stellarwp.com/\">StellarWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://instawp.com/\">InstaWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\">Data Liberation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/webcreatorcommunity/\">Kadence Facebook Group</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"Akismet: Comment Spam: How to Protect Your Site from Spammers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=283729\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"https://akismet.com/blog/comment-spam/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20903:\"<p>Everyone has encountered spam comments at one point or another, but they&#8217;re more than just an eyesore. They actually scare away real visitors, can mess with your search engine rankings, and can even pose serious cybersecurity risks. It&#8217;s a big deal, whether you&#8217;re running a small blog or a major&nbsp;business.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, there&#8217;s something you can do about it, and you don’t have to go it alone. Today, we&#8217;ll talk about what comment spam is and why it&#8217;s so important to tackle it&nbsp;head&#8209;on.</p>\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll also discuss why<a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\"> Akismet</a> is your website&#8217;s best protection against spam comments. It quietly filters out all that junk (without interrupting users with annoying quizzes or buttons to click), so your site stays clean and professional — a place where real conversations can happen&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283729\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is comment&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam clutters up your website&#8217;s comment sections with unwanted messages. Spammers aren’t there to join the conversation but to push their own agenda, which is often sketchy at best. Because there are strong motivations for spammers’ efforts, those with programming knowledge constantly spend time developing new ways to bypass filters and spread spam automatically through sophisticated&nbsp;bots.</p>\n\n<p>Websites and online spaces are constantly evolving, and so are the methods to combat nuisances like comment spam. Google, for instance, rolled out a significant update in<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/10/october-2023-spam-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> October 2023</a> to tackle various types of spam, including cloaking, hacking, auto&#8209;generated, and scraped content across multiple languages​​​​. This shows just how serious the issue has become globally and the efforts being made to keep online spaces&nbsp;spam&#8209;free.</p>\n\n<p>You, however, will still need to take care in preventing comment spam on your own website or blog posts. But more on that in a&nbsp;moment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the motivations behind comment&nbsp;spam?</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam is driven by several motivations, each with its own unique impact on websites and users. Understanding these motivations can help in developing more effective strategies to counter this prevalent&nbsp;issue.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. SEO link&nbsp;building</h3>\n\n<p>The first thing spammers are often after is improving their website&#8217;s ranking on search engines. They sneak links into blog comments or other pages with a comments section, hoping it&#8217;ll boost their site&#8217;s visibility. This trick is known as SEO poisoning because it can actually hurt your own rankings as a result. And it&#8217;s still a booming business, even with many efforts in place to counteract&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Malware&nbsp;distribution</h3>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, some of these comment spammers are out to spread malware. They use those sneaky SEO tactics to get their harmful content boosted in the search results or even post links directly to the malware in the comments themselves. When your visitors click on these links, they might end up with stolen data or&nbsp;worse.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Advertising and&nbsp;promotion</h3>\n\n<p>Lastly, some spammers are just trying to push their products or services. It&#8217;s like those people who hand out flyers on the street, except they&#8217;re leaving their flyers in your comments. They use all sorts of tactics to try to get through on thousands of sites a day (or more), and because they cast such a wide net, even a tiny success rate is worth it for&nbsp;them.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these motivations creates different challenges for site administrators and blog owners. From an SEO standpoint, comment spam can really hurt your site&#8217;s ranking. The spammy people you let hang around can rub off and give you a bad reputation. If search engines find out you&#8217;re unintentionally hosting bad links, they might penalize you. It might not sound fair, but it&#8217;s a fact all the&nbsp;same.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The adverse effects of comment&nbsp;spam</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam can significantly impact a website in various detrimental&nbsp;ways:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Site&nbsp;reputation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Imagine walking into a party and finding trash everywhere. That&#8217;s what a website swamped with spam comments feels like. It screams neglect and poor management. Visitors will likely think twice before engaging, and genuine community members? They might just leave.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>And if those spam comments have links to shady sites, it makes it seem as though you&#8217;ve invited trouble right to your doorstep. Spam comments post a real hit to your site&#8217;s good&nbsp;name.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. SEO&nbsp;consequences</h3>\n\n\n<p>When it comes to SEO, comment spam, as we&#8217;ve already mentioned, is a real problem. Google’s got a sharp eye for sites that house spammy content. If your site is littered with this stuff, Google might think it&#8217;s not up to par, which can mean a nosedive in rankings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Imagine, just when you thought you were getting the hang of SEO, comment spam can pull the rug right from under you. It’s tough because a dip in search rankings means fewer visitors and, ultimately, a hit to potential&nbsp;conversions.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Potential for site&nbsp;blocklisting</h3>\n\n<p>In the worst&#8209;case scenario, too much comment spam can get your site on the search engines&#8217; naughty list, i.e. blocklisted. This happens when your site is seen by search engines as a place with potentially harmful content or that at least links to dangerous websites. Recovering from a blocklisting is no joke, either. It&#8217;s a long and difficult process, so avoiding this is obviously&nbsp;preferable.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common characteristics of comment&nbsp;spam</h2>\n\n<p>Comment spam typically exhibits several common characteristics that can help in identifying and filtering it&nbsp;out:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Links to external&nbsp;websites</h3>\n\n<p>First off, links in blog comments that lead to other sites are classic red flags. These aren&#8217;t just any links, though. They&#8217;re usually totally unrelated to your post and are all about getting more eyeballs on spammers&#8217; sites or boosting their SEO. Often these links pose major threats, leading to places you wouldn&#8217;t want your visitors to end&nbsp;up.</p>\n\n<p>With cybersecurity investments booming to $76 billion in 2023, according to<a href=\"https://hginsights.com/market-reports/market-report-socs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> HG Insights</a>, it&#8217;s clear everyone&#8217;s taking these threats seriously, and not just the big fish but small businesses,&nbsp;too​.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Generic or flattering&nbsp;language</h3>\n\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s the flattery game. Spammers love to post comments using vague, super&#8209;positive comments like &#8220;Great post!&#8221; but they&#8217;re pretty empty and don&#8217;t add much value to your site. They&#8217;re trying to butter you up so you&#8217;ll let their comment slide through. And while not always spam, comments like these definitely raise red&nbsp;flags.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1074\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image.png\" alt=\"example of a flattering spam comment\" class=\"wp-image-283731\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Irrelevant&nbsp;content</h3>\n\n\n<p>Spam comments are completely off-topic. They&#8217;ll slap any old thing in the comment section, as long as they can sneak in a backlink or a plug for something. With phishing websites on the rise,&nbsp;it&#8217;s clear these irrelevant comments are part of a bigger online game.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1216\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-1.png\" alt=\"example of an off-topic spam comment\" class=\"wp-image-283732\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Poorly written&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>Spammers often use comments with grammatical errors either to sneak past filters searching for common spam words, to appear more human, or simply because they’re trying to write in a non&#8209;native language. So comments with numerous grammatical errors should be viewed with&nbsp;suspicion.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1204\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-2.png\" alt=\"example of a spam comment with lots of hashtags\" class=\"wp-image-283733\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Lots of pingbacks and&nbsp;trackbacks</h3>\n\n<p>These are automated or manual notifications sent when one website links to another. While they can enhance interaction between websites, they can also be used for spamming. Distinguishing between genuine and spam trackbacks or pingbacks involves assessing their relevance and the quality of the linking&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1440\" height=\"714\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-3.png\" alt=\"example of a pingback on a blog post\" class=\"wp-image-283734\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. A sudden influx of&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>A ton of comments coming in at once, especially from new or unverified users, can be a sign of spam. This can be a coordinated effort to flood your site with spam&nbsp;comments.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Suspicious usernames or email&nbsp;addresses</h3>\n\n<p>And let&#8217;s not forget the weird usernames and email addresses. These are often pretty obvious with random numbers or bizarre word salad&#8209;style names. It&#8217;s all about creating fake identities to spread spam far and&nbsp;wide.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying these characteristics can help you in effectively managing and reducing the amount of comment spam on your website. And using tools like Akismet can help in automating the process of spam detection and&nbsp;removal.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why common anti&#8209;spam methods fall short (and what to do&nbsp;instead)</h2>\n\n<p>Common anti&#8209;spam methods, though widely used, have limitations that can make them less&nbsp;effective:</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. CAPTCHA and its&nbsp;limitations</h3>\n\n\n<p>While you’re probably used to seeing CAPTCHAs or reCAPTCHAs (those tests that make you do things like decipher a string or random letters or check all the pictures with stoplights) in your everyday life, they can be a real headache for users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"828\" height=\"982\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-4.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA, asking users to select squares with red spheres\" class=\"wp-image-283736\" />\n\n\n<p>Ever found yourself squinting at your screen, trying to figure out if that&#8217;s a letter or a smudge? You&#8217;re not alone. In fact, only about 66% of people get through these tests on their first try, according to the<a href=\"https://baymard.com/blog/captchas-in-checkout\"> Baymard&nbsp;Institute</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Then, there&#8217;s the issue of accessibility. People with visual impairments can find themselves at a disadvantage with visual CAPTCHAs, and the audio alternatives have similar downfalls. Plus, those advanced bots you’re trying to block? They&#8217;re getting better at sneaking past these tests, making CAPTCHAs less effective by the&nbsp;day​​.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Question&#8209;based&nbsp;challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Asking users a question to prove they&#8217;re human seems like a smart move. But it&#8217;s got its pitfalls, too. For one, bots can be programmed to answer common questions. And if your questions are too obscure or complex, you might end up turning away real humans who just wanted to interact with your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Limiting commenting to registered&nbsp;users</h3>\n\n<p>Making people sign up before they can comment is a decent barrier against spam, but it presents its own set of issues. Not everyone wants to go through the hassle of creating an account, especially if they&#8217;re just passing by. So, you might be keeping out the spam, but you&#8217;re also likely missing out on some valuable contributions from casual&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Manual review and approval of all&nbsp;comments</h3>\n\n<p>Having a real person review each comment is great for quality control. But let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s a time&#8209;consuming task. If your site&#8217;s buzzing with activity, staying on top of all those comments can be a daunting, if not impossible,&nbsp;task.</p>\n\n<p>In all of these cases, using a tool like Akismet is a preferable option to keep comment spam under control. Now, let&#8217;s talk about&nbsp;why.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The #1 tool to stop comment spam&nbsp;completely</h2>\n\n<p>Because of its popularity, you’ve probably heard of Akismet in the past — especially if you&#8217;re running a WordPress site. It&#8217;s kind of a big deal in the world of online spam&nbsp;protection.</p>\n\n<p>Created by Automattic, the people behind WordPress.com, Akismet has been at the forefront of spam solutions since 2005. It&#8217;s proven itself to be a reliable ally for website owners who are tired of dealing with comment spam, but don’t want to interrupt users with annoying, unreliable&nbsp;tests.</p>\n\n\n<p>What you may not know is that Akismet provides solutions for more than just WordPress sites. Thanks to its flexible API connection, it can work with many other platforms like Drupal, phpBB3, and Joomla. Abiding by the open source philosophy, Akismet likes to say that it’s built <em>by</em> developers, <em>for</em> developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Akismet&nbsp;works</h3>\n\n\n<p>So, how does Akismet keep those spam comments at bay? It&#8217;s pretty smart. When someone (or some<em>thing</em>) leaves a comment on your site, fills out a form, or submits any other form of text, Akismet’s advanced AI program can analyze it for authenticity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>It’s constantly evolving and learning to maintain its incredible 99.99% accuracy&nbsp;rate.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on your configuration, it can set comments aside for you to review later or automatically delete suspicious ones. Based on your feedback, it can adapt to your site for even improved performance (if that’s even&nbsp;possible).</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is all automated — for both you and your site’s visitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The benefits of using Akismet to block comment&nbsp;spam</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet stands out as the best way to block comment spam&nbsp;because:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>It offers real&#8209;time monitoring and adaptability</strong>. Akismet&#8217;s cloud&#8209;based system constantly learns from the billions of data points it processes from its use on over 100 million sites, allowing it to adapt to new spam techniques and protect websites against the most advanced spam&nbsp;attacks​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It has a database of known spam patterns</strong>. It also uses a massive database and sophisticated algorithms to detect and block spam, which is continuously updated to recognize new spamming&nbsp;methods​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It boasts 99.99% spam detection accuracy</strong>. One of Akismet&#8217;s standout features is its high accuracy rate in spam detection, significantly reducing the likelihood of spam slipping through the&nbsp;cracks​​.</li>\n\n\n<li><strong>You can set it and forget it</strong>. Once configured, Akismet runs autonomously, saving you considerable time and effort that would otherwise be spent on manual spam moderation​​.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n<li><strong>It’s compatible with multiple platforms</strong>. Although primarily known for its integration with WordPress, Akismet can be utilized across various platforms, making it a versatile tool for blocking comment spam, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/forum-spam/\">forum spam</a>, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-stop-contact-form-spam-on-wordpress/\">contact form spam</a>, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-seo-spam-how-to-protect-your-wordpress-site/\">SEO spam</a>, and various other forms of unwanted&nbsp;content​​.</li>\n\n<li><strong>It doesn’t affect the user experience</strong>. Unlike some anti&#8209;spam tools that can be intrusive or cumbersome for users (like CAPTCHAs), Akismet operates in the background without adding friction to the user experience. This is essential for high engagement and conversion&nbsp;rates​​.</li></ol>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to start blocking comment spam today with&nbsp;Akismet</h2>\n\n<p>Blocking comment spam with Akismet can significantly enhance your website&#8217;s user experience and security. Below is a straightforward step&#8209;by&#8209;step guide to get you&nbsp;started.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 1: Install and activate the Akismet&nbsp;plugin</h3>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re using WordPress, there&#8217;s a good chance Akismet is already pre&#8209;installed. However, if it&#8217;s&nbsp;not:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Go to your WordPress&nbsp;dashboard.</li>\n\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Plugins → Add&nbsp;New</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Search for &#8220;Akismet&#8221; in the WordPress plugin&nbsp;directory.</li>\n\n<li>Click <strong>Install Now </strong>next to the Akismet&nbsp;plugin.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> If Akismet isn&#8217;t pre-installed or if you&#8217;re not using WordPress, visit the </em><a href=\"https://akismet.com/developers/getting-started/\"><em>getting started guide</em></a><em> for more information.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n<p>Once the plugin is installed, click the <strong>Activate</strong> button within your WordPress dashboard to activate the Akismet&nbsp;plugin.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"450\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-5.png\" alt=\"installing Akismet in WordPress\" class=\"wp-image-283737\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 2: Obtain and input your API&nbsp;key</h3>\n\n<p>To connect your site to Akismet’s&nbsp;servers:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Visit the Akismet&nbsp;website.</li>\n\n<li>Sign up for an account to obtain an API&nbsp;key.</li>\n\n\n<li>Select the plan that fits your needs (free for personal blogs; paid subscriptions are available for businesses and commercial sites). Enterprise users can <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise-pricing/\">create their own plan or discuss it with an expert</a>.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n<li>Follow the instructions to generate your API&nbsp;key.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image.jpeg\" alt=\"pricing plans for Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-283738\" />\n\n\n<p>After obtaining your API&nbsp;key:</p>\n\n\n<ol><li>Go back to your WordPress&nbsp;dashboard.</li>\n\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Akismet →&nbsp;Settings</strong>.</li>\n\n<li>Enter your API key in the designated field and&nbsp;connect.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"450\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-6.png\" alt=\"adding an API key to Akismet settings\" class=\"wp-image-283739\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 3: Configure Akismet&nbsp;settings</h3>\n\n<p>Once activated, review the default settings for Akismet by going to <strong>Settings → Akismet Anti&#8209;Spam </strong>then finding the <strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;section.</p>\n\n<p>Determine how you&#8217;d like to handle comments flagged as spam as well as the <strong>Strictness</strong> of the spam&nbsp;filter.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Step 4: Monitor and adjust as&nbsp;needed</h3>\n\n<p>With Akismet now operational, you&#8217;ll want to make monitoring the spam filtering process a part of your regular website maintenance schedule. Check in on Akismet&#8217;s settings, pop into the comments marked as spam, and make adjustments to the settings if needed, based on the nature of spam comments your site&nbsp;receives.</p>\n\n<p>By following these steps, Akismet will begin to automatically monitor and filter your website’s comments and form submissions. This automation saves time and ensures a cleaner, more professional online environment for your&nbsp;visitors.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Say goodbye to comment spam with&nbsp;Akismet</h2>\n\n\n<p>All-around, Akismet provides an easy-to-use solution to a massive website-related problem. It works automatically in the background with near-perfect accuracy, and is scalable and customizable for your unique program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">Get started with Akismet</a>.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 14:15:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"Do The Woo Community: WooCommerce Performance Optimization with Sabrina Zeidan and Uros Tasic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=79061\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-optimization/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:450:\"<p>WooCommerce developer Uros and WordPress engineer Sabrina discuss website performance optimization, advocating for awareness, regular testing, and practical tools.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-optimization/\">WooCommerce Performance Optimization with Sabrina Zeidan and Uros Tasic</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce and WordPress Builder Podcast</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Feb 2024 10:41:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:233:\"HeroPress: Words to WordPress: Charting My Path Through Technology and Community! – লেখালেখি থেকে শুরু করে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার পথচলা \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=6519\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:210:\"https://heropress.com/essays/words-to-wordpress-charting-my-path-through-technology-and-community/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=words-to-wordpress-charting-my-path-through-technology-and-community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18834:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020624-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Starting with WordPress might have been a coincidence, but staying with it was a choice.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#bangla\">এই নিবন্ধটি বাংলায় পাওয়া যায়</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey with WordPress started unexpectedly. I will demonstrate my voyage towards WordPress as a freelancer to a full-time job holder and a contributor in the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-i-entered-into-the-world-of-wordpress\">How I Entered into the World of WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2015, I began writing content as a freelancer, not knowing that WordPress would become such a big part of my life. At first, WordPress was just a tool for me to publish my writings. But soon, it turned into much more than that. It became the center of my career. When I graduated from Gono University with a Computer Science and Engineering degree, I didn&#8217;t imagine WordPress would be where I&#8217;d find my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-everyday-i-m-growing-with-wordpress\">Everyday I’m Growing with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After freelancing, I joined weDevs, a company known for creating WordPress plugins. This was a significant change for me. At weDevs, I wasn&#8217;t just writing; I was part of a team that made tools to help people build better websites. I learned a lot about WordPress and how it works from the inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I moved to BuddyBoss, where I became a technical writer. This job was different because I had to explain how things work in a way that everyone could understand. It was challenging but also very rewarding. I enjoyed making complex ideas simple and helping others learn about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-volunteering-and-being-part-of-the-community\">Volunteering and Being Part of the Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best parts of my journey has been volunteering at WordCamps and WordPress Meetups. Going beyond my work responsibilities, I made it a point to engage actively within the community. Till now, I have volunteered at several notable events:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WordCamp Kent 2020 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Northeast Ohio 2021 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp India 2021 (Online)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Asia 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Sylhet 2023</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These events have been enriching for me. They&#8217;ve allowed me to meet people as excited about WordPress as I am. It was great to see how strong and welcoming the WordPress community is, sharing knowledge and experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from that, currently, I am an Organizer of the WordPress Dhaka Community. All these years of working for WordPress paid me really well and recognized me as a community member to serve the Dhaka WordPress enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-i-ve-learned-through-the-journey\">What I&#8217;ve Learned Through the Journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, I see how much I&#8217;ve grown because of WordPress. It started as just a platform for my writing, but it became a way to connect with others, learn new skills, and share my knowledge. My career has taken me to places I never expected, and I&#8217;m grateful for all the opportunities WordPress has given me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned that being open to new experiences and willing to learn can lead you to exciting places. WordPress has been a part of not only my career but also my personal growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My journey with WordPress is far from over. There&#8217;s always something new to learn and more ways to contribute to the community. I&#8217;m excited to see where this path will take me next. Whether it&#8217;s writing, volunteering, or working on new projects, I&#8217;m ready for the challenges and opportunities ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-footnote\">Footnote</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with WordPress might have been a coincidence, but staying with it was a choice I made because of the joy and achievement it brings. My story is simple: it&#8217;s about finding your passion in unexpected places and growing with it. I hope it can inspire others to explore their interests and see where they lead.<br />When it comes to my hobbies, there&#8217;s a long list. I love traveling, reading, watching movies (but not web series), and listening to music. I have two furry babies, Judy and Deany (Shih-Tzu), and plan to adopt a cat soon. These personal joys add another layer of happiness and fulfillment to my life, making my journey with WordPress even more rewarding.

এ প্রতিষ্ঠানে আমি এমন একটি টিমের সাথে যুক্ত ছিলাম, যারা গ্রাহকদের জন্য আরও উন্নত ওয়েবসাইট তৈরি করার প্রয়োজনীয় সরঞ্জাম তৈরি করতো।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি সেখান থেকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস সম্পর্কে অনেক কিছুই শিখি এবং জানতে পারি কিভাবে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসর ব্যাকএন্ড থেকে কাজ হয়। এরবাইরে&nbsp;

সঠিক ভাবে BuddyBoss প্লাগিন ব্যবহার করতে পারবে। এই কাজ আমার কাছে যেমন চ্যালেঞ্জিং ছিল তেমনি ছিল আমার ক্যারিয়ারের জন্য মাইলফলক। টেকনিক্যাল জটিল সব ব্যাপারগুলো সহজভাবে ব্যবহারকারীদের কাছে তুলে ধরতে এবং তাদেরকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শেখানোর কাজটি এখানে থেকে আমি উপভোগ করছি।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ভলেন্টিয়ার এবং কমিউনিটি অর্গানাইজার হিসেবে আমার যাত্রা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস পথচলার অন্যতম অংশ হচ্ছে ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প এবং WordPress Meetups-এ ভলেন্টয়ারী কাজ করা। প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক কাজের বাইরে যেয়ে, আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটিতে সক্রিয়ভাবে জড়িত থাকার চেষ্টা করি। এখন পর্যন্ত, আমি বেশ কয়েকটি উল্লেখযোগ্য ইভেন্টে ভলেন্টিয়ার হয়েছি:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>১।ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প কেন্ট ২০২০ (অনলাইন)<br />২। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প উত্তরপূর্ব ওহাইও ২০২১ (অনলাইন)<br />৩। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প ইন্ডিয়া ২০২১ (অনলাইন)<br />৪। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প এশিয়া ২০২৩ <br />৫। ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প সিলেট ২০২৩</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এই ইভেন্টগুলো আমার জন্য খুবই গুরুত্বপূর্ণ ছিল। এ ইভেন্টগুলতে আমি আমার মতোই অন্য ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস প্রেমিদের সাথে দেখা করার এবং যোগাযোগ করার সুযোগ পাই, যারা আমার মতই ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসকে ভালবাসে। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটি কতটা শক্তিশালী এবং কিভাবে তারা নতুনদের স্বাগত জানাচ্ছে, জ্ঞান আর অভিজ্ঞতা ভাগাভাগি করে নিচ্ছে এ ব্যাপারগুলো দেখতে পারা আমার কাছে দুর্দান্ত এক অভিজ্ঞতা ছিল।&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>বর্তমানে আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস ঢাকা কমিউনিটির একজন অর্গানাইজার। ঢাকা ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কমিউনিটির পক্ষ থেকে ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের ব্যাপারে উৎসাহীদের সহযোগিতা করতে আমাকে একটি কমিউনিটি অর্গানাইজার হিসেবে স্বীকৃতি দেয় যা আমার কাছে সত্যিকার ভাবেই অনেক সন্মানের।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">এ যাত্রাপথে আমি যা শিখেছি</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>অতীতের দিকে ফিরে তাকালে, আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের কারণে কোন পর্যায়ে এসেছি সেটা দেখতে পাই। যা আমার লেখা প্রকাশের একটি প্ল্যাটফর্ম হিসাবে শুরু হয়েছিল, সেটাই এখন অন্যদের সাথে সংযোগ করার মাধ্যম হিসেবে, নতুন দক্ষতা অর্জনের এবং আমার অভিজ্ঞতা অন্যদের সাথে ভাগ করার একটি মাধ্যম হয়ে উঠেছে। আমার কর্মজীবন আমাকে এমন এক জায়গায় নিয়ে এসেছে যা আমি কখনো কল্পনা করিনি। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসই আমাকে এই সব সুযোগ দিয়েছে এর জন্যে আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসর কাছে কৃতজ্ঞ।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি এখান থেকে শিখেছি নতুন কোনো অভিজ্ঞতা ও নতুন কিছু শেখার জন্য আগ্রহী থাকলে নিজেকে অসাধারণ সব জায়গায় নিয়ে যাওয়া সম্ভব। ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শুধুমাত্র আমার কর্মজীবনই নয়, আমার ব্যক্তিগত জ্ঞান সমৃদ্ধিরও একটি অংশ।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">আমার ভবিষ্যৎ পরিকল্পনা</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার যাত্রা কখনোই শেষ হবার নয়। এখানে সবসময় নতুন কিছু শেখার আছে এবং কমিউনিটিতে অবদান রাখার আরও নানান উপায় আছে। এই পথচলা আমাকে পরবর্তী কোথায় নিয়ে যাবে তা দেখতে আমি খুবই উৎসাহী। আমি নতুন চ্যালেঞ্জ এবং সুযোগের জন্য সবসময় প্রস্তুত সেটা লেখা-লেখি, ভলেন্টিয়ারী, বা নতুন প্রজেক্টে কাজ করা যে ভাবেই হোক না কেন।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">আজ এ পর্যন্তই</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে যাত্রা শুরু করা আমার জন্য হয়তো একটি কাকতালীয় ঘটনা ছিল, কিন্তু এখানে কাজ করে আমি যে আনন্দ পেয়েছি এবং যা অর্জন করেছি তা বলে শেষ করার মত নয়৷ আমি আশা করি, আমার এই পথচলার গল্প ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস প্রেমীদের অনুপ্রাণিত করবে এবং আগামীতে নেতৃত্ব দিতে সাহায্য করবে৷</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার শখের একটি দীর্ঘ তালিকা আছে৷ আমি ঘুরে বেড়াতে, বই পড়তে, সিনেমা দেখতে (কিন্তু ওয়েব সিরিজ নয়), এবং গান শুনতে পছন্দ করি। আমার দুটি পোষা কুকুর আছে, জুডি এবং ড্যানি, এবং শীঘ্রই একটি বিড়াল দত্তক নেওয়ার ইচ্ছেও আছে৷ এই নির্মল আনন্দগুলো আমার জীবনে সুখ এবং পরিপূর্ণতার আরেকটি স্তর যোগ করে, যা ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের সাথে আমার যাত্রাকে আরও বেশি ফলপ্রসূ করে তোলে প্রতিদিন। আপনি যদি আমার সাথে যোগাযোগ করতে চান তাহলে বিস্তারিত জানতে আমার ওয়েবসাইট&nbsp;

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;<br /><br />[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, it is February. For many of us, that means we&#8217;ve already fallen off track on our New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but not you, intrepid WordPresser, especially you, newly found WordPresser who is still on the fence about needing a website, and I get it. It seems like a lot of work, and even if you shoot for the moon, it&#8217;s not clear which star you&#8217;ll land on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It feels easier to open a Facebook page or launch a new Instagram account, get a channel going on YouTube, but here&#8217;s a secret they won&#8217;t tell you. It&#8217;s just as much work. And even if you crack the code on today&#8217;s algorithm, you don&#8217;t own anything you build there, not the content, not the audience. So if you&#8217;re gonna make the effort to build anyway, why not build it in your space? It can be scary to take that kind of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re not convinced yet, let me give you a few other reasons why you should choose a website over some social media thing. I&#8217;ve got a list here, and they build on one another, really. But the first thing is a website covers the five W&#8217;s: who, what, when, where, and why. It&#8217;s basic information, I know, but it&#8217;s what people need to know when they&#8217;re looking at your product or company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The phone book, whether you had the yellow pages or the white pages, those are long gone, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the need for that information is gone. When people are researching the right service or product to solve their problems, they&#8217;re getting online to do it. So you should be there, and your information should be easy to find.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:12] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us right into item number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people know these things about you when, they know who you are, what you&#8217;re doing, when to get to you, where you are, why you&#8217;re doing it. Having that information increases trust and makes you look more professional, and I&#8217;ve seen that be counterintuitive for folks. I mean, it&#8217;s a digital asset, after all. But overwhelmingly, we see consumers who are well-researched by the time they get to us. They&#8217;ve looked at all of your competitors already and checked to see if you are a human, if you share some of their values, and how you manage waste or, complaints, or praise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can never know who is looking for you. So, making it all as clear and easy to see as possible makes you more trustworthy. And the more trustworthy and professional you look, then number three, the more chances you have to bring in good leads and contacts, which can turn into sales or, at the very least, a sales opportunity. And it&#8217;s important to have good leads and contacts. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you have your information out there on a website, then people can sort of prequalify themselves. If they already have a sense for whether they are a good fit for your product or service, then fingers crossed. You can spend most of your time with people who are making serious inquiries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And coming in at four, you can do this any way you want with words or art, NFTs of your latest work, or video tutorials. It lets you tell your story in ways that other mediums necessarily have to limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, importantly, you can still do those things elsewhere. Right? But having essentially a digital home online that is yours, keep your stuff online in a place you own and operate, then draw people to you through those other channels. Make it all work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have a fifth thing, mostly because I like lists of either three or five, and the list I had was four, but also because it&#8217;s true. Number five is still true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting domains is fun. You&#8217;ve got something to share with the world, and your domain name is title and, story, and first impression. And isn&#8217;t it great instead of having to say you can find me at LinkedIn, slash in slash, etc.?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can say something quick and memorable. Josepha.blog or whatever it is you registered. Getting domains is fun. It&#8217;s the fifth thing, and I tried to act like it was no big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also, it&#8217;s like one of the first things you have to do, and it&#8217;s kind of a big deal. You can have your own domain, and it can say a lot for you. So there you have it, some basic and not-so-basic reasons why you should have a website. If you are convinced or at least intrigued, I&#8217;ve got a few tutorials that can help you get started that I&#8217;ll link in the show notes.&nbsp;<br /><br />[00:05:03] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have four big things for you today: four-ish. So, first things first, I have some early opportunities for y&#8217;all to test our next major release. Our next major release is WordPress 6.5. The target release date is March 26th. But coming up here on February 13th, we have Beta 1 scheduled. That&#8217;s an early opportunity for you to provide feedback. A lot of the features that we have coming in this release are big, and they&#8217;re moving quite quickly. And so, if you are already a routine WordPress user, pop on over into the core channel or onto make.WordPress.org/core and get your hands on that beta release. We could use a lot of feedback from you on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that I have is that the second cohort of the Contributor Mentorship Program has opened up, and we&#8217;re calling for participants whether you want to be mentored or mentor somebody. We are accepting applications for both. This is a fantastic opportunity for experienced contributors to help other people learn how to do this. And also, if you are learning to contribute to open source and to WordPress for the first time, I know it can be scary. It took me many, many tries to really get started. And so this is a great opportunity for anyone who is trying to contribute in a new way, in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing that I have is there&#8217;s a post up about Data Liberation in 2024. This is one of our big focuses for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A web where being locked into a system should be a thing of the past, and migrating your site to WordPress or around the WordPress ecosystem should be doable with essentially 1-click, and, so, there&#8217;s a lot of work that we&#8217;re doing there. You can find it on WordPress.org/data-liberation. There will be a link to that in our show notes, but also, there is a lot of work that has to be done, not only to get those resources together but also some companion tools to the resources. So head on over there, take a look at what&#8217;s out there. And if you have some stuff to contribute, share that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And my fourth thing, my final thing, is that WordCamp Asia is about a month away. So you still have time to plan your attendance. If that&#8217;s something that you want to do, head on over to asia.wordcamp.org to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

This can be essential for site admins who wish to simplify the editing experience or enforce a consistent content creation strategy by limiting the available blocks to users. Diego explains the methods to achieve this: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li> using functions in the theme’s <code>functions.php</code> file, </li>\n\n\n\n<li>employing a plugin that provides a user interface for block management, or </li>\n\n\n\n<li>using the new block JSON configuration. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each technique will vary in complexity and control, offering solutions for both novice and advanced users.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/\">Need a plugin .zip from Gutenberg&#8217;s master branch?</a></strong><br />Gutenberg Times provides daily build for testing and review. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now available via <a href=\"https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/playnightly.json\">WordPress Playground</a> (no need for a test site) <br />Have you been using it?

Here it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ignite format is a tricky one as a speaker! I will do better next time. My friend Connie has delivered seven Ignite talks now and I thought hers and Adam Savage&#8217;s were the highlights of the ones I saw. (I didn&#8217;t see everything because I was popping in and out.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparing for this sabbatical has been the most fun I&#8217;ve had working at Automattic, ever. It brought so much clarity to things, we&#8217;ve been able to resolve in hours things that have lingered for months, including two acquisitions, several hires, big strategies, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this talk I caught a redeye to NYC to meet with the WordPress.com leadership team and hand off my leadership there to Daniel Bachhuber. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a beautiful symmetry that the first-ever sabbatical taken at Automattic was by its CEO at the time, Toni Schneider, which gave me the opportunity to step in and try on being a CEO, and it&#8217;s an incredible gift that Toni is returning to be CEO of Automattic while I&#8217;m out for the months of February, March, and April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What am I going to do with all this free time?

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, using the GatherPress plugin for WordPress event organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Mike Auteri. Mike is an Associate Director of Engineering at Penske Media Corporation, as well as the founder and engineering lead of the GatherPress project. He&#8217;s contributed to WordPress Core and Gutenberg, is a WordPress community team supporter, has written plugins, presented at meetups and WordCamps, and is a co-organiser of the WordPress Monclair meetup in New Jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve attended a WordPress meetup event, it&#8217;s quite likely that you registered for that via the meetup.com platform. It&#8217;s become the defacto way for organisers of events to plan their meetups, send out invites, subscribe users, and promote future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, Mike decided that it was time for WordPress events to have a WordPress based solution for event management. And so he set to work creating GatherPress, which is the focus of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike talks about the way events are currently managed, and why he thinks it&#8217;s time to transition to something more home grown. He thinks that GatherPress represents a significant leap forward in enhancing the event planning and participation experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the development journey of GatherPress, discussing its current features, and the advantages he feels it offers to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also examine GatherPress&#8217; capacity to enable event coordination, and foster meaningful community engagement. He&#8217;s envisioning a future where event management built on top of WordPress is a hallmark of the WordPress event experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the roadmap features that are just around the corner, as well as chatting about the community which has grown up around the plugin, and how that community is looking for people to help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a WordPress event organizer, or have attended a meetup in the past and are curious about how this could be handled by a freely available plugin, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WP Tavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, without further delay, I bring you Mike Auteri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Mike Auteri. How are you doing, Mike?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:35] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Hey, how&#8217;s it going, Nathan? How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very well, thank you. Thank you for joining us on the podcast today, really appreciate it. We are going to be talking a little bit today about a plugin, possibly a community, possibly the replacement of a service. Let&#8217;s find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are recording it at the end of January, 2024. In fact, on January the 23rd. This is a significant date, as you&#8217;ll hear a little bit later in the podcast. We&#8217;re going to be talking about meetups, and WordPress events, and the organisation thereof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike, before we begin, just to give some context to who you are. You don&#8217;t have to go into the weeds of the plugin that we&#8217;re going to be talking about, but if you just want to give us a little bit of backstory, tell us your relationship with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:17] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure. Currently I work for a company called Penske Media. I&#8217;ve been there for almost nine years, I&#8217;m an associate director of engineering there. I got into WordPress years and years and years ago. Maybe not as long as some folks, but I would say around 2008, is when I started dabbling with WordPress, mostly building some people&#8217;s sites in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, I was more of a front end developer. And I would say in like 2012, I think, I switched over to working in WordPress professionally, for media companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much. Okay, so the topic under discussion today is something called GatherPress. Now it may be a good idea, right at the top of the show, to ask you to pause, and go to GatherPress.org. It&#8217;s exactly as you&#8217;d expect it to be spelled, but I&#8217;ll do it at anyway. G-A-T-H-E-R-P-R-E-S-S.org GatherPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you will find most of the things that we&#8217;re going to talk about today. It is, if you like, it&#8217;s a possible replacement for something called Meetup, which is a SaaS service. You can find that at meetup.com. And if you&#8217;ve ever attended a WordPress, let&#8217;s say not WordCamp necessarily, but a more local meetup event, something like that. It&#8217;s quite likely that you have collided with the Meetup platform, because it&#8217;s typically how things are organised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Meetup, coincidentally I think, came into the news over the last few weeks, because they have been acquired by a company. And at the point of acquisition of a company, I think users often question, what&#8217;s going on there? What will the future look like for that? But I&#8217;m guessing, I have a suspicion, more than a suspicion, that you&#8217;ve been thinking about stepping away from Meetup as a solution for organising events for a time, because GatherPress has a history much longer than just the last few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, if, like me, you are not an organiser of events, but you&#8217;ve collided with Meetup just as somebody that signs up, so that you can actually register for events, tell us a little bit about it, and why you feel that maybe a plugin for the WordPress ecosystem is possibly a preferred solution to SaaS product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:30] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So that&#8217;s a funny question. I&#8217;ve been a meetup organiser since 2017, and I really got my foot in the door, and there&#8217;s a whole other story of when I changed my career. If you look me up on YouTube, you could probably find a whole talk on that. But Meetup is the reason why I am where I am today, by the networking and finding very, very talented folks, that kind of became cheerleaders for me as I tried to make it in as a software engineer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But years ago when I was an organiser, one of the folks that attended said, why don&#8217;t we just build something on WordPress? And at that time I thought it was blasphemy, I&#8217;m like, that would never work. We need discoverability for a meetup, no one would ever find us, that just can&#8217;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Couple years later, a little thing called the dashboard widget appeared in WordPress, which started promoting meetups and WordCamps. And I&#8217;ll tell you like, once that hit WordPress, our numbers went through the roof. People were finding us left and right through the dashboard widget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one of the reasons why I think, for the last couple years, we could have been able to move off of Meetup, or at least been less reliant on it, is because of that dashboard widget. Most of the folks that I speak to, that attend to our meetups, find us through the dashboard widget. Less of them find us through meetup.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that&#8217;s anecdotal, and I&#8217;m sure there is data to back this up that I don&#8217;t have, but I&#8217;ve spoken to other organisers, and I hear similar stories, that I think we get higher quality folks. And what I mean by that is people that actually show up, that sign up and show up to a meetup from the dashboard widget, than we do from the discoverability of meetup.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a really credible answer. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve got anything more you want to add, but certainly that does help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:12] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. I&#8217;ll stay with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so I guess we should paint some context around that. So Meetup is in no way connected with WordPress, other than the fact that it is used by the WordPress community. You don&#8217;t have to have a WordPress event in order to use Meetup. It could be for literally any kind of event. You can sign up as anybody out there, and set up any kind of event. So your local history council, or something like that could be using Meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I suppose, back in the day, there was almost like this SEO piece, where you wanted discoverability, you wanted the fact that your local meetup was going to be taking place this Tuesday to be announced globally. And shouting into the void was very hard, and so having people come through a platform where they&#8217;ve already signed up, and they&#8217;ve already got themselves an account, and the platform knew more about where they lived and all that was quite useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it sounds like what you are saying is, that because it&#8217;s a generic platform, and you could be signed up for all sorts of reasons, people might have signed up to the actual event on Tuesday, or Thursday, or whatever, you know, next month, that actual real world event. But then didn&#8217;t kind of follow through, because they really weren&#8217;t in the WordPress ecosystem, they just collided with it by accident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then this dashboard widget comes along. Every single instance of WordPress has it, whether it&#8217;s visible or not is up to you. But it says, you know, it tells you what&#8217;s going on and where. And maybe there&#8217;s more of a hot lead feel to those people, because they&#8217;re actually interacting with WordPress, not just the platform. Have I encapsulated that about right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:39] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I kind of get in the head of someone that would see the dashboard widget. You think about someone that just started their business, and put up their WordPress site and they&#8217;re like, now what? And they&#8217;re sitting in the admin, not sure what to do next. And the first thing they see is a meetup that is meeting next week, that&#8217;s like a mile away from their house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is powerful. Thinking like, wow, I can get help, because I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing here. And we see a lot of folks like that. They come to, especially our help desks, a lot of DIY people. People that are starting businesses. They&#8217;re not sure how to get started, but they see that dashboard widget. And that was an incredible addition to WordPress, and to expanding our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the Meetup platform has really great uses. You know, this is not an exercise in taking Meetup apart. It&#8217;s more an exercise in, well, given that there&#8217;s a bunch of software engineers behind the WordPress project, and there&#8217;s a plugin architecture, why not explore the options to create it inside of WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that really is what GatherPress is aiming to do. It&#8217;s aiming to give you, dear listener, the opportunity to download a plugin, and organise your meeting within your WordPress admin. And now obviously you could set up a, you know, a unique domain, or you could set up something in a website that you already have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, do you just want to run through, maybe the more philosophical position, the open source position? Why do you feel it&#8217;s a good idea to have this as a plugin? What is it that you feel it brings as a plugin, as opposed to the service which we&#8217;ve been using until now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:11] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure. You know, we&#8217;re kind of alluding to it. You know, WordPress is an open source community, and has some incredibly talented folks. And this isn&#8217;t really breaking new ground in a lot of ways. There are event management plugins out there, there are plenty of them, and some of them have whole businesses around their event management plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I am after though, is one that stays true to the WordPress community&#8217;s roadmap of what they would want to see for an event management plugin. Meetup is the odd one out, when you think of the infrastructure that is of the WordPress community. If you look at wordpress.org, wordcamp.org, wordpress.tv, even wordpress.com, they&#8217;re all powered by WordPress. They&#8217;re all services. They&#8217;re all supporting the community using the software that we work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The odd one out is meetup.com, and there was a reason for it originally. And there is still a reason to have it there now, but I think we could start exploring the idea of, what if meetups were powered by WordPress? What are the advantages? And I feel like there are lots of advantages. Think about, you mentioned with meetup.com before is, it&#8217;s very general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we&#8217;re being more specific with say, a community run multi-site, if you think of like how WordCamps function, a large WordPress multi-site, that.org stands up. If we did the same thing for Meetup, we could promote other meetups within meetups. We can promote WordCamps within meetups, say in sidebars. We can promote learning materials. We have full control over the content, and how it&#8217;s placed, and where it&#8217;s placed, in order to best educate and help the folks that are landing on this type of meetup page that&#8217;s powered by WordPress, and what they know is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we&#8217;d be able to really draw people into the WordPress community a lot sooner, by using something that&#8217;s powered by WordPress, as opposed to something on meetup.com, where they think, maybe, the WordPress community goes as far as their local meetup. They won&#8217;t know that like, right off the bat, that WordPress is global, that WordCamps are huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been to like WordCamp US or WordCamp Europe, these are very, very large. Like especially when people only have a local view, and they&#8217;re like, oh yeah, WordCamp US, that&#8217;s three hours from my house, I think I&#8217;ll go. People are amazed at how large, and how extensive the community is. By being able to do something that&#8217;s powered by WordPress, we&#8217;d be able to do that a lot sooner for those folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Has your North Star, whilst you&#8217;ve been creating this, been more or less direct replacement for the feature set that Meetup offers? I guess what I&#8217;m introducing here is, tell us a little bit about the functionality that you have shipped thus far. We can get onto roadmap features and things like that in the future. I was curious if the intention of the GatherPress plugin and project, is to literally have a replacement for meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, is the WordPress meetup format the North Star? You know, the intention is it&#8217;ll achieve all of those things. But it&#8217;s not intended to be a more general plugin for anybody else. You know, it&#8217;s specifically created to replicate live events for WordPress. What you&#8217;re thinking there, really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:26] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. I absolutely used meetup.com as an example. They&#8217;ve been doing this for years, so I want to make sure that we had the features, especially the important features that matter to the WordPress community as far as I could tell. Because, like I said, I&#8217;ve been a WordPress meetup organiser since 2017. Making sure that all those features are there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I think of myself as a WordPress organiser, I&#8217;m like, okay, if I was to do something powered by WordPress, what would this thing need to do, in order for me to be like, yeah, I could use this instead of meetup.com? So I kind of use that as my starting place. And as I mentioned before, like, we started working on this in 2019. And it&#8217;s kind of evolved since then. It&#8217;s not really the same thing it was when it started. I would say it probably became stable about two years ago of like, okay, this is exactly what we&#8217;re building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve had other folks that have jumped onto the project, and giving their insights as well. Some as, you know, people that attended meetups, some people that were also organisers, and trying to build the feature set that we would expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we started this, blocks were pretty new. Like I said, 2019, so blocks were still pretty new at that point. And I wanted to build this to be very forward thinking, and be like, this is going to leverage all the great stuff that has been coming out of core around blocks, making it easy for folks to come in and use the GatherPress blocks in order to RSVP, see a list of people that have RSVP&#8217;d. Add to calendar block, a specific date block for scheduling. All these features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also looked at the event manager plugin, as another idea of that&#8217;s a popular, not quite exactly what I was looking at, but still an event management plugin. And seeing the ways they translated these things into WordPress, and took what I thought would be a good user interface. And, you know, between the two of those, started building GatherPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you mentioned there, blocks. So, is that the primary interface for interacting? You set up a post, or a page, or whatever it may be, and you&#8217;re dragging blocks in, which I guess are adjacent to certain features. So you may drag one in that is a GatherPress block, and it asks you for, you know, when do you want to put this event on? Where exactly is it located? And all that kind of stuff. And then it will present that data on the front end. Have I got that roughly correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:49] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah, roughly, like we make it a little bit easier with block templates, for the event itself. So, I mean, granted you can, you know, move the blocks around all you want, but it&#8217;ll start you off with a block placement that makes sense. So someone that is a little less savvy, will know where to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have, in addition to events, we also have the ability to add and create venues, and tie those venues to the events. All of those are post types, venues actually, a mixture of a post type and a taxonomy. I won&#8217;t get into the technical aspect of that, but it&#8217;s pretty neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have various settings within the GatherPress plugin to customise how you want your event to look. And I have to hand it to Patricia, she played a huge role in this, because I came at this from a very American point of view. And she was mentioning to me, I want to change the date format. I&#8217;m like, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we start building settings for changing date formats and, you know, exploring all the different ways we need to translate the plugin. And we actually translated into a few languages already, which is pretty cool. And a lot of it was helped from her and Javier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the intention really is for non-technical users to be able to download the plugin, follow some basic data entry, you know, dates, times, map locations, that kind of thing. Perhaps internationalise it in some way, and then click publish and you&#8217;re off to the races. You&#8217;ll have something on the front end that people can see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess you&#8217;ve got two markets for this. You&#8217;ve got to be thinking about how the people wishing to attend the event are going to be interacting, and what you&#8217;ll do with that data. But you&#8217;ve also got to make sure it&#8217;s nice and straightforward for the people who are organising the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so let&#8217;s talk about those two different roles a little bit. What features do you bring, let&#8217;s begin with the, I&#8217;m an event organiser. What features do you bring to enable me to do that? You know, you mentioned these blocks, and that you can say what the title of the event is, and bind it to a location, and all of that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But does it offer me functionality to, for example, see a list of who&#8217;s signed up for this particular event, see a list of who&#8217;s cancelled? I don&#8217;t know, in some way communicate with them, email the people who have responded, but haven&#8217;t got involved in that event yet. All those kind of things that we might see in a dedicated SaaS app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:03] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure, yeah. So a few of those features are in their infancy. Like, one of our big things was, what do we need for a minimum viable product for this plugin? So we&#8217;ve been focusing on that. So some of this stuff isn&#8217;t quite there yet, but a lot of it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have, so for instance, an RSVP response block. So if you go to the event, and you are logged in, you can click on the RSVP button, and say you&#8217;re attending. Once you click on that attending, in real time, it shows you that you are now in the attendance list. Kind of like how Meetup functions, in a lot of ways. So if you go to meetup.com, a new event is there, you say, yeah, I&#8217;m going to go, and you click attend, now you&#8217;re on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So everybody can see that you are now attending. You would also change it to be not attending, and you will then be in a list of folks that are not attending, if you change your mind and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody&#8217;s able to see that. These are all different blocks that are within the event post type. They also tie in with some, getting a little bit more technical, tie into database tables and such, in order to store that data. So they&#8217;re not stored in the block, they&#8217;re stored in the database, and are represented in that block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have not added a feature yet to it, but this is in our next release. We&#8217;re currently at 0.27. In 0.28, we are working on an admin interface, for an administrator to be able to remove or add people to a list, like automatically from that block. We have not finished that yet, but that is in progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also adding a feature, so if people can list themselves anonymously that they&#8217;re attending. So if they don&#8217;t want their name or profile photo to show up, they can be anonymous. They&#8217;ll be anonymous to everybody other than administrators, administrators will know who&#8217;s showing up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not a feature of meetup.com, but that is a feature that folks that I&#8217;ve heard from in the WordPress community, actually I think Courtney was one of the ones that mentioned it. Some people want to just show up and not, you know, people to know who they are. And we do have that feature also in WordCamps, for folks that don&#8217;t want to be shown as listed, that they&#8217;re attending a WordCamp for privacy reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When you attend a WordCamp, like WordCamp US, one of the options at the point of purchasing the ticket is to, I guess it&#8217;s the same thing. It&#8217;s not really anonymous in the same way, but you just don&#8217;t appear on the website. You just decline to be on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:18] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. So in GatherPress, and it&#8217;s kind of the same way, instead of a display name, it&#8217;ll say anonymous. And instead of a photo, it&#8217;ll show like a, you know, the generic avatar listed. So it will show that someone is attending, but it won&#8217;t show who.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. You&#8217;re able as the administrator of the event, the organiser of the event, to communicate with these people? Is there a fairly straight forward way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:37] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah. So we do have, and this is, again, still in its infancy, we have the ability to compose messages, and send to people in the community. You can have a couple of check boxes that say, contact all members, people that are attending, people that are on the wait list, we do have a wait list feature, and people that are not attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So between these check boxes, you can click on a button that pulls up a modal in the admin, write your message, hit send, and that&#8217;ll send out an email to the designated folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you don&#8217;t mind me sort of interrupting that point, how are you handling email? Do you have connections with certain SMTP services, or is that just something else you have to handle elsewhere, possibly with a plugin? And do you queue the emails so they go in batches, or, what&#8217;s the intention there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:21] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So it&#8217;s using wp_mail, which is the, you know, underneath the layer of everything is kind of a generic email. By default you will use PHP mail. You can use the WP SMTP plugin, which we are using on gatherpress.org, to set it up with a certain service in order to have deliverability, what you want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I am always thinking about, with this plugin in particular, it&#8217;s like we don&#8217;t want to do too much. There&#8217;s plenty of plugins that do a thing better than we would do it. And we should use those plugins, verses trying to duplicate a feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, one of my other thoughts is like, say BuddyPress. BuddyPress has a lot of community features to it. It would be great to use GatherPress and BuddyPress, and making sure the two play nice together, and integrate well together. And not have things in GatherPress do things that BuddyPress could do better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same instance, we just want to send emails. And whatever service you want to use, a plugin to handle your service, that&#8217;s what you should do. And we&#8217;re not going to be too opinionated about that. We will just make sure that we send it through WP Mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, yeah. But in terms of the administration of the event, do you have options to, I don&#8217;t know, recycle events? So you&#8217;ve run a very successful event, everything that you&#8217;d set up on a previous event checked out, you&#8217;re really happy with the way it was. Have you got options to, more or less, duplicate that event, and carry on from there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:44] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Currently that&#8217;s on the roadmap. Being able to have a recurring event is, we do have a ticket in our backlog that did not make it into the MVP, because that, as you can imagine, is a bit more complicated. I do have a plan for it. So I do have an architecture and plan that I&#8217;m putting together. But it is not in the core plugin yet. Currently, like, for say, our current GatherPress events, I think it&#8217;s called Duplicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Duplicate Post, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:11] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Duplicate Post, yeah. I just use that, because we have the same weekly huddle. Every week I just clone it, put in the new date, and publish. So it&#8217;s one more step than having something that would be recurring. But it&#8217;s not that bad, and that kind of works for now. And that&#8217;s kind of what we&#8217;re using until that feature is built. And that is definitely on our roadmap though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Lovely. And of course, we know what happened during the last four years or so. Covid came, all the events went away, and we were forced into Zoom and online events. And some of those are still happening, some of the events haven&#8217;t come back in the real world. Is there any options in there to, you know, not use the map and to, I don&#8217;t know, bind it to a Zoom link and an online event, something along those lines?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Absolutely. So that was absolutely in our MVP, because we were building this during Covid, so that was front and center of our thinking. And a lot of time went into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our venue options, so if you&#8217;re creating an event, an online event is automatically there, since an online event is just an online event, and it doesn&#8217;t require a map, it doesn&#8217;t require any specifics, it&#8217;s just online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you select that, it gives you an option to add, say, a Zoom link, or Google Meet, or Teams, or whatever you&#8217;re hosting your online meetup at. A recent feature we put into this is that the online link, or the Zoom link, or whatever it is, will not be available until five minutes before the event starts. So you don&#8217;t have people like jumping in there when they&#8217;re not supposed to be, and such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was a feature we added, that&#8217;s actually not on Meetup. Meetup, you see that online link. But we added a feature that will kind of hide the event link. And when I mean hide, I mean hide hide, like it&#8217;s not in APIs and any of that fun stuff. So it&#8217;s pretty well, behind closed doors at that point. But it becomes available once you&#8217;re logged in, and five minutes before the event. That&#8217;s kind of how we set it for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So as an admin, all of that makes perfect sense. It sounds really straightforward and simple. There are some videos, by the way, on the GatherPress website. So you can go and check out the UI, and everything we&#8217;ve just described is there, visible for you to see, there&#8217;s a nice run through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, from the end user&#8217;s point of view, the person who&#8217;s attending the event, I guess it&#8217;s just a case of discovering the website, going there, entering an email address, and confirming a link, or something like that. And of course, given that your block is showing data, I guess you can, as the admin, you can modify where that&#8217;s displayed. And you can pad it with other content with different blocks, you know, if you want to add something before it and after it, you can do all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is that basically it? I show up to your website, I enter an email address, and from that point on, I&#8217;m expecting email to arrive, and then to attend the event itself. Can that happen online, if it is an online event? Do you have the option to do that? Or, have you got to go your own way there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:01] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> The way it would function, from an end user&#8217;s point of view, if you came onto the site and you&#8217;re not logged in, it will ask you to either log in or register for the site. So one of the things with a GatherPress site, if it&#8217;s something that you&#8217;re trying to attract the public to, you&#8217;ll have to, you know, check the box that says anybody can register for the site. And there is a notification when you install the plugin to say, hey, you might want to do this, you know, turn this on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once that&#8217;s turned on, if you, Nathan, were to come to the GatherPress site, you would then register. You know, like I said, we try not to be too opinionated. WordPress allows registration, WordPress allows login, so we&#8217;re going to leverage the default behavior of how WordPress functions there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, we&#8217;re going to look to extend on that, if people want a more, a different kind of look and feel for that. But, at the bare bones, we want people to be able to register and log in, like any other WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;re logged in, it&#8217;ll take you back. You know, once you create an account, you can go back to that event. You click RSVP, then you can say, I&#8217;m attending this, and you click the attend button. And now you&#8217;re on the list of people that are attending, and you&#8217;ll, you know, if the organiser sends out an email to those attending, you&#8217;ll receive that email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And should I wish to unsubscribe, is there options there? You know, I&#8217;m thinking GDPR, and all those kind of things. If I wish to no longer receive the emails, all of that, that&#8217;s taken care of, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:22] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So that is not. I need to work on that piece. One of the things we were looking to do with integration with BuddyPress was, BuddyPress has those options to turn off notifications. So leveraging that aspect of BuddyPress, but GatherPress will have to do a bare minimum for that too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So you have to login to each event&#8217;s website. So let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s a WordPress meetup in the UK. There might be one in Bristol, there might be one in Brighton, and London, and Manchester, and all these other different places. I would need to go and make an account on each of those websites, should they choose to use GatherPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess one of the benefits of meetup.com was that you just had this one sign up, which was kind of nice. I&#8217;m wondering around there, do you have any intuitions or thoughts on federating that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:04] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> So that&#8217;s exactly what our proposal was. So our proposal is, if you think of it how WordCamps function, right? That they&#8217;re on a multi-site. So multi-sites use the same user database, right? What we would ideally want folks to use in this is, what they would log into wordpress.org with, so their profile, the wordpress.org profile, and utilise that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we have a multi-site powered, you know, with the event management powered by GatherPress, if you went to any of those meetups and they&#8217;re on that multi-site, it would be the same login for all of them. So then you&#8217;d be able to log into all of those different sites, and be able to say, I&#8217;m attending this, and it&#8217;s all the same user, it&#8217;s your WordPress profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is that then something you are hoping to put together in terms of infrastructure and maintenance thereof? A multi-site network where you can sign up as an admin, and bag brighton.gatherpress.com, or whatever it might be. And therefore you can federate that account login, and presumably therefore you could distribute, you could create another dashboard widget, which had all of the events that were in that multi-site network, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:08] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Right. So the idea is like, we&#8217;ve been talking and working with the meta team already. So like I&#8217;ve had conversations with say like Ian Dunn. He seemed pretty into the idea of setting up another network, kind of how we have with WordCamps, but with meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And setting up that network that would leverage the same sort of infrastructure that we are already kind of used to with wordpress.org and wordcamp.org, and be able to host those meetups in a multi-site, that have opted in to start using this new platform. Then being able to use their WordPress profile to log in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, there was also kind of some, you know, chat and thought about like, maybe someone should explore a single sign on with Meetup credentials, for people that still find it through Meetup. So if they already have Meetup credentials, maybe they can leverage that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But trying to remove a lot of the friction, where we can, is a big thing like, you and I both know like, you don&#8217;t want a million logins, and I don&#8217;t want a million logins to all different meetups. We want to keep that as simple as possible, and as straightforward as possible. Because the success of a project like this relies on people being able to easily create a, like, you know, have an account, or create one account, and be able to go to all those different WordPress meetups in that multi-site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think so. I think there&#8217;s something more likely to get off the ground, if there&#8217;s just one login. And then you can actually see, I don&#8217;t know, you could go as far as putting a map of the world up and, put pins in it based upon the events that are happening in the next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:33] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> The events page already, the events.wordpress, I think it&#8217;s events.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m blanking right now, but that has like all the different events that are happening. That was put together, I guess a couple months ago. But it was one of the reasons I started pushing forward on this, being like, hey, we are starting to use WordPress infrastructure for our events more seriously. This is a project I&#8217;ve been leading for the last couple years to help with that initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m looking at the documentation page, and helpfully there&#8217;s, obviously the documentation on the page itself, but you&#8217;ve got some links for users, you know, poeple who just wish to try out the plugin. But also developers, presumably if they wish to extend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a GitHub repository. All of this will be linked to in the show notes for this podcast. So if you go to wptavern.com, and look for the podcast episode associated with this, you&#8217;ll be able to find all of that there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also at the bottom, you&#8217;ve got a list of upcoming features. Now, I know that you&#8217;ve touched on a few of these, but if you just want list out what&#8217;s not been mentioned so far, if you can remember. And yeah, what&#8217;s in the roadmap for the near future, I guess?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:36] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> One of the big things that people, you know, I&#8217;ve thought of and people have confirmed, especially moving something like this is like, well, what about all the events I have on meetup.com? Like, how can I migrate those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the thoughts, like I mentioned, I&#8217;m very thoughtful about what goes into the core plugin for GatherPress. And anything that is kind of like, well, that&#8217;s specific to this, right? Say, if you&#8217;re migrating from meetup.com to GatherPress, you&#8217;d want some functionality to be able to do that easily and seamlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not everybody using GatherPress, so I don&#8217;t see that as a core feature of the plugin, but I do see that as a companion plugin. So that&#8217;s going to be our first, what we call companion plugin, called GatherPress Meetup Importer. And what that will do is take an API key from meetup.com, and be able to import the meetups that you&#8217;ve had already, on Meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since, like I mentioned, a lot of the features from meetup.com to GatherPress were close to apples to apples, we&#8217;d be able to take that data, and put it in the right spot for GatherPress. And then maybe running an ongoing job, so if you were, say, I want to be able to still use meetup.com to first publish, and have GatherPress ingest it as I go through, like kind of a trial and transition. We want to be able to have folks be able to do that too. And maybe like direct traffic to their GatherPress site, while still maintaining, for at least the time being, their presence on meetup.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s one of our first plugins that, you know, we&#8217;ve started on. I&#8217;ve been testing it, works great. There&#8217;s another plugin that does this already, and we&#8217;re kind of using that as a model, for building one that&#8217;s very specific and very, all the features are specific to GatherPress is kind of what we&#8217;re after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s great. I&#8217;ll just list off a couple of other things that are mentioned here. So I&#8217;ve got the ability for attendees to be listed anonymously, you mentioned that. Allow attendees to add guests. That&#8217;s nice. Import events, that&#8217;s the one you&#8217;ve just mentioned. Recurring events, so rather than duplicating the posts, there&#8217;ll be something built in, different functionality. A calendar block, presumably to show the events in a way that you might look at your Google calendar or something, you see it by date. And this is nice, probably underestimated how important it is, the email notification when the events start. I think that&#8217;s really crucial, especially if it&#8217;s a live event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:52] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Right now I just compose, and say starting five minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Easy to forget though. And you never know how many people you are sort of leaving behind, if that notification fails to go out. So that&#8217;s really nice. But also, the bit that I alluded to at the beginning, right at the beginning when I said that the date was the 23rd of January, comes now because, Patricia, that you mentioned, and I&#8217;ll link to this in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a pilot program, which you launched by pure coincidence, yesterday. So 22nd of Jan 2024. What is the community pilot program? What&#8217;s its intention? Who are you trying to get on board? Just tell us a little bit about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:25] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Sure, yeah. So that is the project that I mentioned about, building something into the wordpress.org infrastructure that powers meetups. So much like, you know, the meta team is behind the wordcamp.org, or wordpress.tv, or just wordpress.org. We want to have another multi-site in that network, for meetup events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re pushing for GatherPress to be the community plugin, that does the event management for that particular infrastructure. We have some meetups, and some more that have even responded to the proposal saying like, yeah, we&#8217;d love to be part of that pilot program too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a couple that are in the US, I think five that are in Switzerland, and some in Spain, that would love to be part of this pilot program, where we put this multi-site together. Each site on that multi-site is a meetup group. And then they start using that in tandem with meetup.com, in order to start driving more events around, within this WordPress powered event system. And starting to slowly move off meetup.com, and seeing how it goes. You know, see if something like that would be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you&#8217;re after community members. And just before we end the podcast, in a moment, I&#8217;ll ask for your contact details, and what have you. If you go to gatherpress.org, the way that I&#8217;m seeing about the community program, is because it is the most recent blog post, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m looking at what looks like an archive of blog posts. But I noticed that the archive of blog posts is probably in some way using GatherPress itself, because I&#8217;ve got these RSVP buttons, and if I click into the GatherPress weekly huddle, I notice that I&#8217;ve got add to calendar links, and I&#8217;ve got an RSVP button, which invokes a modal. Is that GatherPress in action?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:08] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> That is GatherPress in action. Anybody can join. 11:00 am Eastern Standard Time. We have our GatherPress weekly huddle, and that&#8217;s when the team gets together. Any folks that are interested in GatherPress, there&#8217;s a Zoom link. It&#8217;s an online event. And we have that every week on Fridays. So Friday, 11:00 am, Eastern Time, we have those every week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And if you go to gatherpress.org, you&#8217;ll be able to see them, well, as the page currently stands you can see them, and obviously the most recent one in this case rises to the top. So you can just scroll down a little way, and click the button to RSVP, and get yourself set up in that community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:45] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> You can click through and see more event details. But, yeah, that is another block that we have for pages, called Event List. That will show various events, whether past or upcoming. So that&#8217;s another feature of GatherPress as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve thought of everything. Brilliant. Okay, just before we knock it on the head then, Mike, I think probably some people listening to this will be in tune with what you&#8217;re saying, and hopefully will wish to reach out to you, to find out more about the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, they could go to the website, that&#8217;s a given. If they want to contact you personally, or in more personal way, do you have a social network handle that you hang out on, or an email address that you&#8217;re willing to give out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:19] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Twitter&#8217;s a good one. It&#8217;s M Auteri, M-A-U-T-E-R-I. So my first initial and my last name, you can find us there. If you send me a DM, and we have a GatherPress Slack. We also have a GatherPress Twitter, which we&#8217;re starting to use a little bit more, now that we&#8217;ve gone a little bit more public with it. And that is just GatherPress. So if you find GatherPress on Twitter, spelled exactly as it is on the website. You can follow us there. You know, we just started using that Twitter account, so I don&#8217;t even know if it has any followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. There&#8217;s also, in the main navigation of the gatherpress.org website, there&#8217;s an item entitled Get Involved. And if you click over there, you&#8217;ll be able to see a contact form, plus the GatherPress Slack group link is there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:59] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah, I think Mervin added that like yesterday, so that all brand new stuff, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is all shiny and new, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s lovely. The feeling that you get from these brand new products is so engaging, and I really hope that you managed to keep the momentum going. It sounds like you&#8217;ve got a lot of interest in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:16] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Yeah We&#8217;ve been keeping that momentum going. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Thank so much for chatting to us about GatherPress today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:22] <strong>Mike Auteri:</strong> Thank you for having me. I appreciate it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mauteri\">Mike Auteri</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike is an Associate Director of Engineering at Penske Media Corporation, as well as the founder and engineering lead of the <a href=\"https://gatherpress.org/\">GatherPress project</a>. He’s contributed code to WordPress Core and Gutenberg, is a WordPress community team supporter, has written plugins, presented at meetups and WordCamps, and is a co-organiser of the WordPress Montclair Meetup in New Jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve attended a WordPress meetup event, it’s quite likely that you registered for that via the meetup.com platform. It’s become the defacto way for organisers of events to plan their meetups, send out invites, subscribe users, and promote future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, Mike decided that it was time for WordPress events to have a WordPress based solution for event management, and so he set to work creating GatherPress, which is the focus of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike talks about the way events are currently managed and why he thinks it’s time to transition to something more home-grown. He thinks that GatherPress represents a significant leap forward in enhancing the event planning and participation experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the development journey of GatherPress, discussing its current features and the advantages he feels it offers to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also examine GatherPress&#8217;s capacity to enable event coordination and foster meaningful community engagement. He’s envisioning a future where event management built on top of WordPress is a hallmark of the WordPress event experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the roadmap features that are just around the corner, as well as chatting about the community which has grown up around the plugin, and how that community is looking for people to help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a WordPress event organiser, or have attended a meetup in the past and are curious about how this could be handled by a freely available plugin, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pmc.com/\">Penske Media Corporation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\">meetup.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gatherpress.org/\">GatherPress plugin website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress/\">GatherPress GitHub repository</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/01/22/proposal-pilot-program-to-test-gatherpress-on-the-wordpress-org-network-as-a-meetup-alternative/\">Proposal: Pilot program to test GatherPress on the WordPress.org network as a Meetup alternative</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mauteri\">Mike&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gatherpress.slack.com/\">GatherPress Slack group</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatherpress\">GatherPress Twitter</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Jan 2024 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.4.3 – Maintenance and Security release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=16754\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/01/wordpress-6-4-3-maintenance-and-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7054:\"<p>This security and maintenance release features <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&component=!Bundled+Theme&id=!59828&milestone=6.4.3&group=status&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=version&col=keywords&order=priority\">5 bug fixes on Core</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/5698#issuecomment-1909302298\">16 bug fixes for the Block Editor</a>, and 2 security fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Because this is a security release, it is recommended that you update your sites immediately.</strong> Backports are also available for other major WordPress releases, 4.1 and later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.4.3.zip\">download WordPress 6.4.3 from WordPress.org</a>, or visit your WordPress Dashboard, click “Updates”, and then click “Update Now”.

Just kidding. But we did introduce a concept into Automattic that I think will provide a lot of clarity for the teams within Automattic, and hopefully for the broader WordPress ecosystem that works and partners with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame is there&#8217;s a game, each person gets a card: Be the Host, Help the Host, or Neutral.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You cannot change cards during the course of your day or week. If you do not feel aligned with your card, you need to change divisions within Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re Be the Host, you are hyper-competitive. You are trying to make the case to a customer for why they should host with you and not consider anyone else. This is what everyone assumes all of Automattic is, but it&#8217;s actually just one sub-division, which is a minority of our revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Help the Hosts, your word is <strong>ecosystem</strong>. You plant the seeds of open source software that grow everywhere. Every WordPress is precious to you, wherever it grew up. You want every host to be as successful as possible, because the real threat is from the Big Proprietary folks outside, who steal all your good ideas and don’t let you touch them again. You want to get to know every WordPress in the world, however it grew up, and help it out by selling it attachments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neutral treats everyone equally, either because they don&#8217;t care (Day One, Pocket Casts, et cetera don&#8217;t have a horse in this race) or because they are a support function like finance or HR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever you meet or talk to an Automattician you can ask what their card is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, WordPress.com is going to orient itself more towards developers, and have an experience that feels similar to WordPress hosted other places, less Calypso more wp-admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big tension this surfaced was Woo Express, going forward that team is switching under WP.com, and Woo.com will recommend a variety of hosts (like W.org) to get started with Woo. Now people can meet with Paul Maiorana, who leads Woo, or James Grierson, who leads Jetpack, and know they have Help the Hosts cards as their teleological goal.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 28 Jan 2024 20:08:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: Freedom Grants\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=110880\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://ma.tt/2024/01/freedom-grants/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:729:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://audrey.co/scholars/\">Audrey Scholars program</a> is still getting started, but I wanted to introduce another opportunity: <a href=\"https://audrey.co/freedom-grants/\">Freedom grants</a>.

This three-day event emerged as a vibrant celebration showcasing the collaboration, diversity, and innovation that drive the world&#8217;s most popular web platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Asian WordPress flagship event started with a dedicated Contributor Day, followed by two days of engaging talks, panels, hands-on workshops, and networking. Notable guests, including WordPress Cofounder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a> and Executive Director <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, joined the diverse lineup of <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speakers/\">speakers</a>. Popular topics featured cutting-edge web technologies and trends, use cases, open source dynamics, and more. WordPress enthusiasts seized the opportunity to gain insights from international and local industry experts and to learn about the project&#8217;s future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Converting walled gardens into community gardens</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 8, Josepha Haden Chomphosy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/UK7FnaEeTrU?si=0H6eEEijj4tDWm_t&amp;t=30830\">took the stage</a> for an insightful journey comparing and contrasting the “walled” and “community” gardens in software ecosystems, drawing an analogy between closed and open source platforms. After exploring both concepts, she posed an important question to the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:2px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>What would it take for someone to move from a walled garden to a community garden?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:2px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source software, symbolized by community gardens, represents freedom from copyright restrictions and usage limitations. Unlike proprietary software (described as walled gardens), the core value lies in long-term empowerment, giving people control and ownership of their digital presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acknowledging the longstanding values held by WordPress and its open source community for two decades, Josepha focused on the importance of caring for foundations that make us strong, managing what distracts us, and nurturing growth by embracing new opportunities.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> At the end of this week, WordCamp Asia is happening. It&#8217;s one of our largest events dedicated to WordPress, and it will cover a wide range of topics. From advanced concepts like running thriving businesses to more beginner things like building your first theme, there is bound to be something for you at this event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who have the opportunity to attend in person, you might also be going to your first-ever Contributor Day. Now, as much as I want there to be something for everyone there, I recognize that it&#8217;s a little more frenetic than your average WordPress event. It&#8217;s not any less welcoming than the event that has like a schedule and, tracks, and rooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:19] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But in my experience of any group of open source contributors, they get really excited when they are tackling problems together. And that&#8217;s most of what happens at a Contributor Day. It can make it a little difficult to see how you can join in. But never fear; the crew at the WordPress Briefing has you covered. We&#8217;ve got a couple of ways you can contribute immediately, no code required, and a handful of good next steps when you&#8217;re feeling comfortable and ready to level up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For total beginners, so you&#8217;ve got a WordPress site, or you know, you&#8217;re about to launch one. And you&#8217;re here to learn and meet people and hopefully find someone who answers the questions you feel too shy to mention in public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So these two ways of contribution are for you. First, you can contribute photos. WordPress has a photo directory for openly licensed photos, which are included in Openverse searches. Users can submit photographs to be used by folks all over the world. There are some basic guidelines, such as no faces or identifying characteristics. It can&#8217;t be overly edited or processed, but even photos taken on a smartphone are accepted. Because we understand that the best camera is the one you have on you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:30] <strong>Josepha</strong>: You can also contribute translations. If you speak a language other than English, you can visit <code>translate.WordPress.org</code> and help translate not only the WordPress software but also plugins, themes, and other parts of the WordPress project into your native language. Since more than half of all WordPress installations are in non-English languages, adding or improving translations is really impactful. We are actually at WordCamp Asia trialing a new self-serve translation day process. So that&#8217;s a great place to have a double impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So those are your two completely code-free ways that you can contribute, completely beginner friendly ways to contribute at Contributor Day coming up later this week. And then for your next steps, so say that you&#8217;ve had your site for a while, you are an absolute expert in the admin, you&#8217;ve had to answer a few tough questions for yourself, you&#8217;ve watched a lot of tutorials, and so now you&#8217;re thinking of ways you can share that knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Here are a few ways that you can exercise your new knowledge and really solidify it in your brain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can contribute help. Supporting other WordPress users is a great way to give back to WordPress. This can involve answering questions, providing guidance, or even providing the right resources to users. You can check out the WordPress support forums for more information, and they actually have a dedicated support team as well that works toward making sure that WordPress users have answers to the questions they are asking. You can head over to WordPress.org/support/forums and just pick an appropriate area for you, something that you are currently an expert in, and start answering questions. Start contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Second thing you can do is you can contribute patterns. So WordPress has a dedicated Patterns directory, which stores a list of Block patterns. So custom designs that were created using blocks in Gutenberg that then can be used across any WordPress site, anyone&#8217;s WordPress site. You can submit those patterns, any pattern that you built, to the directory, and then they can be used by people all around the world. Basically, like anything with WordPress, if you put it in there, it can be used by anyone all around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing is that you can contribute events. This is one of my favorite ways to contribute. Organizing in person events to an extent has no code requirement to it, but also it does kind of require that you have a good understanding of your local community and have a willingness to get out there and build your network.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is where it is today thanks to its excellent community and all the lovely in-person events that happen all over the world. They bring our community together, and anyone can contribute by helping to organize just a small gathering or support an in-person event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The fourth way that you can level up your contributions is to contribute by breaking things. I know that sounds weird, but testing the software to see where it breaks is actually a really valuable contribution. It&#8217;s as easy as downloading the WordPress beta tester plugin and the test reports plugin to a WordPress installation, Preferably a testing one, not one that&#8217;s currently publicly in use. But you can test out the newest version of WordPress before the release and provide useful feedback to the development team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the fifth way that you can level up your contribution is to contribute learning. Not that you are learning as a contribution, but what one person can learn through a tutorial or documentation, another person has to learn through discussion and hands-on learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This team, the folks over at <code>learn.WordPress.org</code>, they are the official team and official learning platform and resource for WordPress. They host video tutorials. Yes, but also host live online workshops, courses and even provide lesson plans on different topics related to WordPress. So if you are an educator or otherwise really like to help spread knowledge around, pass around the knowledge that has been hard-earned by you, this is an excellent opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And of course, if you are brave and afraid of nothing, then you can just go to Contributor Day and move from table to table until something sounds interesting to you. You don&#8217;t have to have a plan. Your whole plan can absolutely be to wander until you are found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:45] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now to our small list of big things. It&#8217;s actually a very small list today. I&#8217;ve got two things on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The first is that a couple of weeks back, we published the results from the 2023 annual survey. So, each year, we collect some high-level data about trends and themes across this vast ecosystem of users and site builders, people who extend WordPress core, and contributors who build WordPress core to help inform decision-making and provide valuable feedback on the project status. I looked at the results from our last survey. We had a bit of an increase in the respondents, not as much as we would have liked, but still a little bit greater number than we had in the past couple of years. And I have a lot of questions myself about what we are doing compared to what we are being asked to do and so go take a look at the blog post that has some highlights from it. It&#8217;s got a couple of contextual pieces of information in there as well, and come with your questions to WordCamps around the world or ask them in community meetings as you find them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the second thing is actually that we have kind of a pilot program going on. There&#8217;s a proposal out right now about GatherPress. It&#8217;s a group of community leaders that have built a tool, a community plugin, to help gather WordPress events a bit better and a bit more &#8220;open source-ely&#8221;. It&#8217;s open currently to anyone who is running a WordPress meetup group that is interested in learning more about how a WordPress-first and open source first community gathering tool might look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;ll have a link to the proposal in the show notes that&#8217;ll give you more detailed information and give you an opportunity to figure out how you can join that pilot and help us figure out whether it will work or not ultimately for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I have with me today a couple of guests, Ryan Welcher and Mario Santos, who have joined me to talk about the Interactivity API. This is an API that we&#8217;ve been working on for quite a while, and it&#8217;s a fascinating thing. It&#8217;s really specifically user-facing in its functionality but makes a lot of work streamlined for everyday developers, whether you are building something for yourself, for your family, or for a client. This whole project probably is gonna really speak to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hi, guys, and welcome to the show. First-time guests, both of you. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:15] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yes. First time for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:17] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thanks for inviting us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. Well, why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, like your name, what you do with WordPress, how you contribute to the project, something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:27] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I can go first. My name is Ryan Welcher. I&#8217;m a developer advocate and sponsored by Automattic. Then, I contribute full-time to the WordPress project by creating documentation, doing live streams, creating videos, and just generally trying to be helpful in in the space to help engineers and extenders work with the various APIs in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:46] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love the just generally trying to be helpful part. Mario, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:52] <strong>Mario:</strong> He really is. He really does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:55] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m Mario Santos. I&#8217;m also a sponsored contributor, and I&#8217;m more focused on the project management and developer. I consider myself a mix of both. Right now I&#8217;m working on projects that are focused on improving the developer experience especially. That can go from the Block API to the Interactivity API; that is the topic today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Very nice. Very nice. Just lots of helping that everyone&#8217;s trying to do. I think that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;re talking about the Interactivity API today. And, Mario, I believe it was almost a year ago that you first put this proposal out into the WordPress project. Do you wanna tell us a little bit about just, like, where the idea of this came from? Like, I know it wasn&#8217;t originally called the Interactivity API, but, like, what was you said you do some a bit of product, a bit of development. Like, what was it about this idea that was so important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:48] <strong>Mario:</strong> Yeah. Sure. So, basically, well, the proposal came, like, one year ago, but it has been in the works, like, for many years, I would say. Just to give a bit more context, previously, before being a sponsored contributor, I was working at a startup called Frontity Framework, and we were building a React framework to enable rich user experiences on top of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So basically, it was a framework for headless WordPress. And at some point, we became sponsored contributors, the idea was to bring those user experiences to those rich and cool websites that lead to WordPress. So, you don&#8217;t need an external framework to create them, and you can do that directly in WordPress. So that&#8217;s where the idea of the Interactivity API comes from. From there, we started exploring different possibilities and tailoring it more to WordPress to ensure it works with its APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think after many many months working on that, the Interactivity API is the result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I just wanted to note that you started that answer with, like, the proposal was about a year ago, but the work had been happening for a long time. I think that&#8217;s generally true, and it&#8217;s not something that we always really acknowledge. This happens with patents also. This is going to be a strange tangent, but this is how we do in in my brain. This is how my brain works. So frequently, you&#8217;ll see a brand new product, but the patent for it was, like, 30 years beforehand, like, way before you ever see anything. And I think that&#8217;s kinda how this works also with software development. Like, the idea, has been going for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The problem was identified a long time ago. And by the time you see something that helps to solve the problem or bring a new set of features to you, like, you didn&#8217;t know, but it had been being worked on for, like, five years or something. And I think that&#8217;s such a fascinating thing. That&#8217;s always apparent to me, but I think it&#8217;s not really apparent for a lot of people in the, in I don&#8217;t know, who use software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna say in the space, quote, unquote, but that&#8217;s not even it. Like, it&#8217;s the people who are using software. We don&#8217;t know how long anything&#8217;s been under development. We just know that at some point, a magical thing appeared, and we get to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So speaking of the problems that we have identified that we&#8217;re trying to solve with this. Like, was there an inherent problem that you all were trying to solve as you were coming up with this idea around the Interactivity API itself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:16] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say that trying to summarize it, it covers many things, but the main problem was that creating those kinds of interactions in the client was kind of difficult. You had to manage many things many tools, and each developer could come up with different solutions, and maybe they don&#8217;t combine well together. So, the idea is to provide an extended way so developers don&#8217;t have to take care of many things. They just have to take care of the interactions they wanna create. And ensuring that it works well with the WordPress way, it works well with the block system, and any block created with this Interactivity API can communicate with each other. You can combine those blocks, and you are not gonna encounter any problem. So, I would say that the main issue we were trying to solve is that there wasn&#8217;t a standard solution. There were different approaches taken by different developers, and that could create some issues. So, until now, Gutenberg has been mainly focused on the editor side and how blocks are created. And this is a first attempt to to cover the part of the front end, the interactions that users may want to create in the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] <strong>Ryan:</strong> It solves a ton of problems. But, I mean, coming from someone like, I have a fair amount of agency experience. I&#8217;ve been, you know, you&#8217;re working on large projects. And every time someone solves a problem, they solve it slightly differently. And that&#8217;s problematic because you switch teams or, you know, someone else picks up the code base, and all of a sudden, now they have to learn your custom system that&#8217;s slightly different from the one that I built last week and the one that, you know, someone else built two weeks earlier. And this takes the guesswork out. It takes the sort of the plumbing out of the equation. One of the reasons I really loves working with WordPress when I started working with WordPress was that when I was building for clients, I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building the CMS. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about building a menu system or figuring out how to handle media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:10] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I just had to do the things that that client was paying me to do. Like, I just had to make their site look the way that they wanted it to. And with the Interactivity API, I think there&#8217;s a bit of that where I don&#8217;t have to worry about figuring out how am I gonna get all these pieces to talk to each other on the front end. It&#8217;s all there. I just have to connect the dots, and it makes it very, very simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m building the site right now for a workshop that I&#8217;m gonna be giving a WordCamp Asia, which is a a shameless plug. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Coming up so fast, y&#8217;all. WordCamp Asia is, like, two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I&#8217;m so excited. I have so much work to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve built an entire voting system on a website where people can pick what we&#8217;re going to be talking about in my workshop, and I built it in the Interactivity API, and it took me, you know, probably five hours. And that&#8217;s me trying to learn some things and mess around with it. And to do that without the Interactivity API would have probably been an entire React-based, you know, completely outside of WordPress. I would have loaded one thing on the page and had it build out my whole application, and now I&#8217;m doing it with blocks and I&#8217;m doing it with a block theme. So if I wanna move those blocks around. I can move the blocks around. I can change anything that I wanna change inside of WordPress the way I would normally, and all that in interactivity just still works. And that&#8217;s It&#8217;s awesome. I just I love it. I can&#8217;t like, the Interactivity API, not my website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But also both. Like, it can be both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> I wanted to say that I think it&#8217;s a great point. I like to think about it like having the best of both worlds. Right now, we have modern frameworks like React, Vue that are used to create these cool websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the Interactivity API plus WordPress brings everything together. Like, you can create those cool user experiences while keeping the full power of WordPress, its management system, the Block editor, and to be honest, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything like that out there. Like having the best of both both worlds because we are still working with blocks, and that&#8217;s amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:04] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Given that it&#8217;s still, it&#8217;s not even been released yet. Like, it&#8217;s coming very soon. But.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. This is all still in the Gutenberg plugin. So, like, if you don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, get the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> But just how mature the API is now, considering it is still kind of not even fully released, it&#8217;s only gonna get better? I just think it&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, kudos to Mario and your team for doing all this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you. Kudos to everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, I&#8217;ve a question that I think probably, Ryan, you can start with, but then also probably, Mario, you&#8217;re gonna have some opinions on also. In this conversation so far, we&#8217;ve done a lot of, like, when you want to have these interactions and also when you want to have these cool experiences. For folks who actually do not know what the Interactivity API is yet, and they don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about when we say these interactions like, what exactly are we talking about from a user perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, what types of things will users be able to see when they are experiencing the Interactivity API&#8217;s features and functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:07] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a great question. From a user standpoint, it&#8217;ll just look like your regular website, I think. Depending on what you&#8217;re doing. So, like the interactions that we&#8217;re talking about is when you&#8217;re in the browser and you wanna click a button and expand something, for example, or you wanna click an image and have the lightbox pop-up, which is in core now, that&#8217;s driven by the Interactivity API, but these interactions are basically when a user wants to interact with something, what it does. That&#8217;s a really generic way of saying it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Our current favorite example and, Ryan, it sounds like you also have another example. But our current favorite example is like a movie collection site, you know? And so, like, when we&#8217;re talking about what the Interactivity API is going to power, it&#8217;s things like, when you favorite a series of movies, and then you can, and it just updates that on the fly, and you&#8217;ll be able to in essentially real-time as instant as reasonably possible based on your computer and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Like, then look at your list of things that you favorited or things like that. Like, for folks who don&#8217;t understand interactive site like, all of us know that that, like, if you get on a site, you have interacted with it. But when we&#8217;re talking about Interactivity API, we&#8217;re talking about types of direct actions users can take. Right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:19] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would say yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are just only triggered by some actions. It could be scrolling, clicking, or, or whatever. But, it can go from a simple example like drop down or a popover to more complex things like the movies demo, where you can navigate and the page is not reloading, and that allows you to play a trailer. It starts in a pop-up, and you can keep navigating through different pages, and the trailer keeps playing without reloading. Another example could be instant search; like you start typing the search, and it directly updates the list of films, in this case, that are shown, those kinds of things that happen In the browser.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And Ryan said you, you said that you, like, built a whole survey system, A whole polling system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah, a voting system. So there&#8217;s a series of buttons, each one representing a certain topic, and people can vote, and it tallies the amount. So each, I&#8217;m calling them recipes, has amount of time associated with it, and then so you vote until you run out of time, at which point, like in its tracking it all, and it&#8217;s showing you how much time you voted, how much is left, and once you&#8217;ve run out of time it blurs like it disables all of the voting buttons so you can&#8217;t add more because you run out of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So if you remove one, you can add again. It&#8217;s very, very powerful. And, like, before the Interactivity API, you would have to have, I would have built that whole thing in React, and it would have been one single application that just get loaded on a page. And I just think it&#8217;s amazing. And, like the, the ability to create what are called, like, single page applications or what have always sort of been called SPAs or single page applications where you&#8217;re not reloading the browser every single time you click on a link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to do some things to make that work, but that&#8217;s just available to you and in WordPress. That&#8217;s amazing. I just think that&#8217;s so neat. I mean, it&#8217;s already powering things like the Query Loop block has the ability to move pagination without reloading the page, which is, sounds like a sort of a like a okay, great, like sort of, you know, mundane thing but imagine you had two or three different query loops sitting on your homepage and you wanted to be able to paginate through each one and not refresh the page. That&#8217;s a fantastic user experience that now is just enabled and otherwise was not possible prior to the Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I feel like the Query Loop block was, like, a three-year project four years ago. And I had forgotten about it, which is surprising because I was so concerned with it when we were working directly on it all the time. But yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s exactly the kind of example.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve talked about kind of the user thing and people who are gonna build stuff for clients. But, like, if you&#8217;re a contributor and you want to figure out more about either how to use this or how to expand on what is already there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We already talked about how it&#8217;s in the Gutenberg plugin. It&#8217;s kind of experimental over there. But, like, do you all have like, good first bugs? Things that can be worked on in there? Or is there, like, an experiment zone where people can just be like, this is what I tried with the Interactivity API until it broke? How do people work with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would like to clarify first, it&#8217;s right now, it&#8217;s private in, it&#8217;s a private API in WordPress core in 6.4, And it&#8217;s public in Gutenberg, but it&#8217;s gonna be a public API already in WordPress 6.5. So, yes. Anyone can start testing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to get involved is first sharing what interactions you want to see. I mean, everyone has different ideas, and we will love to know the interactions that people want to create using the Interactivity API, so that would be the first step. Then, test it, create your own blocks or site, and send feedback what do you like what you don&#8217;t like. Raise issues, and for that, we are mainly using GitHub. We created a new category in GitHub in the Gutenberg plugin discussions, and we try to to keep everything there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Mario:</strong> So if you have any questions any feedback, you can share it there. You can also find more discussions about the road map, the change log, many things that are going on right now. And, yeah, I would say those are the ways of getting involved, and I can also expect, maybe Ryan can tell you more here, to start working more on tutorials or videos or whatever. And for me, personally, I would love to see the community working on that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:43] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Yeah. I can, yeah. I think that from a contributor standpoint, especially those who are trying to get into contributing, because, I mean, it&#8217;s not not complicated. Let&#8217;s put it that way, like the Interactivity API. And that&#8217;s not meaning to be a barrier to anyone, but a great place to start is documentation. A great place to start is going through those docs and making sure they&#8217;re up to date and, you know, saying, oh, well, that&#8217;s supposed to do this, so let me go try that. And if it works, great. If it doesn&#8217;t, you know, file a bug, update the documentation, that&#8217;s a great way to get started. It&#8217;s gonna familiarize yourself with the code base and what it&#8217;s supposed to do. And then, sort of, just through osmosis, you&#8217;ll start to pick up more about it. And for anyone starting to contribute to the WordPress project in general, I would say starting with documentation or unit testing is a really, really great way to kinda, dip your toe in the water and not feel too frustrated. And tutorials and demos and show us what you&#8217;re building. We wanna see it. I mean, send it to me, and I will show everyone that I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Ryan:</strong> I mean, we wanna see what what people are building with it and because, you know, just like WordPress, I always use this example, but, like, people used to hack WordPress until we got a hook added for that particular thing that they were adding. So, if we don&#8217;t know what people are building or wanting to build with it, we can&#8217;t make those things happen. So knowing what people are building, how they&#8217;re building, and what they can&#8217;t build, what they&#8217;re running into, what issues they&#8217;re running into is the best way to contribute. So, so people smarter than me can build it for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that call out, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, you know, the theory of tech adoption. And for things like the Interactivity API where we&#8217;re still kind of in the early adopter phase like, Ryan, you&#8217;re an early adopter. You&#8217;re doing everything you think you want to be able to do until it breaks. And, like, I love, like, test it till it fails as a concept of how to get involved in something because, like, you&#8217;re just experimenting, and we encourage experimentation in open source and in open source software and certainly in WordPress. And so, like, it is an unusual thing to think of, like, the best way that I can give back to this project, that I can contribute to this project and make sure that it continues to succeed long term is by using it until the wheels fall off and then tell people what made the wheels fall off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that is a change in thought, But you&#8217;re right. Like, it&#8217;s a very old school open source idea to just get in there and see where it breaks, and tell us. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all we need. And I love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But I just passed my 9-year anniversary being a sponsored contributor, and I was in WordPress for a little bit before it. And so, like, I&#8217;m officially the old guard of us, and so the fact that I&#8217;m, like, so excited about the fact that people are gonna come in and break Mario&#8217;s stuff. Mario, don&#8217;t be scared. It&#8217;s how it works. But also, like, I do find that very exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:31] <strong>Mario:</strong> I&#8217;m willing to see how people break things; that&#8217;s what we need. I totally agree with your reasoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. So I do have kind of, just, like, a final question for y&#8217;all. If there were one thing that you wanted the people who are listening to the WordPress Briefing to know about the Interactivity API, like a hidden gem, a little secret trick. Like, what would it be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:57] <strong>Mario:</strong> For me, the most exciting part of the Interactivity API is the functionality the client-side navigation enables because there are many, many things there. And I&#8217;m sure that there are many things we haven&#8217;t thought about yet, and the community will come up with some ideas and that would be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:17] <strong>Ryan:</strong> For me, the thing is, I love how integrated it is with WordPress, and I know a lot of thought has gone into that without getting too into the weeds. The reasons the decisions that were made were made was so all the hooks and filters and all that goodness that we&#8217;ve had for 20 years is still gonna work. And with the HTML API, the tag processor stuff that&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, it&#8217;s just so cool. It works so well with WordPress. It just works and that&#8217;s probably it for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I work with it, I&#8217;m not having to do any weird janky filtering or stuff that, like, you know, the things that I want to do are not hindered by the Interactivity API. The rather, I&#8217;m able to do more things because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> I prefer Ryan&#8217;s answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:00] <strong>Mario:</strong> It&#8217;s something really important and it&#8217;s something we usually take for granted that it just works with WordPress APIs and the Block Editor, but if you think more about it, it&#8217;s amazing. Like, It&#8217;s what makes it really powerful, I I believe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For what it&#8217;s worth, I think that&#8217;s true for a lot of, like, the R&amp;D type things that we&#8217;re working on in the project right now. Right? Across Our ecosystem, like WP Playground. It is mind-boggling how progressive that is as a concept, and we currently have, like, you know, 25 ideas about what we could do with it, and we&#8217;re currently working on, like, five because we&#8217;ve got two and a half developers on it or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, like, the expectation that it will just work is there for everybody who has, is not part of the R&amp;D process, but for everyone else who&#8217;s, like, been watching its development over time, shocking. Shocking that it works at all. Not because it wasn&#8217;t supposed to work, but because, like, if someone had asked you five years ago if it was gonna be possible to run WordPress development environments locally and then also just export it and import it into whatever host you want. Like, without a host, without a server, we would all think that you were nuts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:22] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Amazing what&#8217;s happening there and, like, some of the things that we&#8217;re seeing, people who are, like, researching with AI in the WordPress space doing? Equally shocking. All of these things. Like, had you said anything to me about it five years ago, I&#8217;d be like, well, that is a mystery. So, every once in a while, I do have wild ideas about things that I wish we could do with our software. And so yesterday, I went and looked at a prototype for something that someone built based on a wish that I had in 2019. In 2019, I was like, you can play Skyrim on an Amazon Dot using just your voice. So like, why can&#8217;t we build a website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then in 2021, someone prototyped that for me. It was ridiculous. It was very bad. It was hilarious. But, also, like, it took 35 minutes to create a &#8216;Hello world&#8217; page, which was ridiculous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, like, what we&#8217;re looking at, the research that I keep seeing from that AI space is people saying, like, I&#8217;m gonna put in a plain text prompt. I need a website as a yoga instructor who also makes custom hats. Right? And then, like, poof. You have this thing that kinda looks like a website with your basic functions and features using the blocks that we have created for WordPress. Like it&#8217;s fascinating how far it&#8217;s come. And that&#8217;s in 2021. It was literally impossible the last time that I was talking about it with anyone, equally literally impossible. Everyone&#8217;s like, plain language prompts for stuff, like that is just a pipe dream. Get away from us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I keep seeing, like, these demos of the research, and it&#8217;s not as far away as we all thought it was. For all these things, Playground, Interactivity API, The AI research is being done. Like, we&#8217;re just a walking R&amp;D group over here in WordPress, and I love it. It&#8217;s fascinating. We&#8217;re just making the impossible possible every day, and I think that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] <strong>Ryan:</strong> So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Sorry. I got really sidetracked. Do y&#8217;all have anything that you wanted to be sure to share about either the Interactivity API or anything that&#8217;s coming up? Something you wanna make that our listeners know?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Mario:</strong> I would just like to emphasize that we love feedback. Please share your feedback. If you test it, yeah, if you think it&#8217;s bad feedback, share it with us as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s especially the feedback we like. I don&#8217;t like this part. That&#8217;s great. We we want to know because the idea is that it serves all purposes for this kind of interactions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That nothing new, but I would like to emphasize that part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You know what? There&#8217;s nothing new under the sun. It&#8217;s fine. You&#8217;re good. You should always tell people what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Ryan:</strong> If you&#8217;re interested in getting started with the Interactivity API and just don&#8217;t have any idea where to begin, there&#8217;s actually a pack there. There&#8217;s a Create Block template. So the Create Block package allows you to to quickly scaffold blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a template that&#8217;s part of the Gutenberg repository. It&#8217;s been published on it and NPM. And it will scaffold a very simple block out for you and it&#8217;ll give you, it&#8217;ll show you all the plumbing and how all the pieces work together. So, I think that&#8217;s a fantastic place to get started. It&#8217;s a very simple block. It just basically shows and hides a message, but it&#8217;s all done via the Interactivity API, but it&#8217;s a really, really great sort of, like, like, &#8216;Hello world&#8217; style. I&#8217;m gonna shamelessly self-promote myself at WordCamp Asia. I&#8217;ll be at WordCamp Asia this year doing a workshop where I will be doing some stuff with your Interactivity API. But, if you&#8217;re there and you wanna chat more about the Interactivity API, I am all ears, and I love talking about this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Cool. Ryan, Mario thank you so much for joining me today. This has been a wonderful conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Ryan:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Mario:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So I hope that you all find that whole project as fascinating as I find it. The Interactivity API is, I know, something that we&#8217;ve kind of been talking about for a while. It showed up specifically in State of the Word, and it&#8217;s hard to understand how important, how vital that work is going to be until you really get your hands on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I recommend you get in there. You take a look at it. I think also Ryan has a few live streams that he does, and he&#8217;s planning on a couple for the Interactivity API coming up. And so just keep an eye out for all of that as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:37] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:49] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now that brings us to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, it&#8217;s a bunch of feedback and documentation. So, first things first. Did you know that the Documentation Team holds an online monthly Contributor Day on the fourth Tuesday of every month. It&#8217;s just an online docs day, and I love it. So, the next one that&#8217;s coming up is February 27th. We&#8217;re looking for folks to help. So show up, figure out how to get some docs done, and make the WordPress project easier to follow, one bit of documentation at a time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next thing that I have is a request for feedback. So, we announced in December that we have a new centralized WordPress events landing page on WordPress.org, and we wanted to give more visibility to all kinds of WordPress events across the globe. But as always, we really could use your feedback about what is useful for you, what you had hoped to see, what you didn&#8217;t see. So, leave your comments with any relevant feedback about how you would improve those pages and the text on it. If you&#8217;re missing anything relevant, if there are ideas that you have for what could be there, all ideas are welcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, the third thing that I have on our list today is another documentation thing. So, over the last year, a group of contributors have been working to improve the block development onboarding experience within the Block Editor handbook. That contains over 400 published pages, and the effort in 2023 to kind of overhaul that and make it easier was just the beginning. So, it&#8217;s a daunting task. It&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s complex, but improving documentation is one of the easiest ways to contribute to the WordPress project, especially If there are just quick fixes like typos or formatting. Feedback on the existing content, such as the new block tutorial, is invaluable. And so, if you have not taken a look at those yet, wander over to the show notes, click a link or two, take a look, get some feedback to us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

This reflects project-wide efforts to increase utilization of these respectively. However, positive sentiment about WordPress is down modestly, and more so among contributors. The analysis of the annual survey highlights certain areas that could benefit from increased attention in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the highlights split into three parts: logistics, general trends, and contributor sentiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Logistics</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Completions were up 17% in 2023, though short of a goal to double them, despite increased promotion and partnership with some hosting partners.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Polyglots team translated the survey from English into 9 different languages, the most ever for the survey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Debuted a new platform, Alchemer, for improved accessibility, usability, data collection, administration, and analysis.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The completion rate increased again from last year’s high of 63% to 79% in 2023, proving that investing some time in the new platform and clarifying wording was well worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">General trends</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>NPS* was 30.1 overall, with contributors at 27.9 and non-contributors at 32. The NPS has trended downward since 2021, when it was 45. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>60% of respondents indicate usage of Gutenberg, 8% are unsure, and 12% use something other than Gutenberg and/or the Classic Editor. This is up from 2022 (54%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>45% of respondents indicate that the WordPress Site Editor meets their site-building needs, 26% are indifferent, and 29% disagree.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>61% of respondents indicate familiarity with block themes and plugins. While this question was not asked previously, in 2022, 53% said they had used blocks<br>“In the new site editor.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security, performance, and stability were the top three critical areas respondents considered when building their website, plugin, theme, or style variation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>63% agree that WordPress is as good or better than other CMSs, down from 68% in 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents indicated that the best things about WordPress are that it is open source, has ample plugin options, incorporates good customization, is easy to use, and offers flexibility. This is similar to 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Limitless configurations, performance, scalability, accessibility, integration, hosting, and support all saw 100% or more increases compared to 2022 regarding favorite things about WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents cited “too many plugins,” “the site editing experience,” “security,” and “performance” as the top four worst things about WordPress. Most interestingly, though, 16% indicated that none of the 20 topics were terrible, and there was a 43% decrease in the number of people indicating that “site editing is difficult to learn.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search engines and YouTube continue to be the two most common resources for finding information about WordPress, while those writing about WordPress, in general, saw a sharp decline year over year.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor sentiment</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>58% of self-identified contributors to WordPress said they agree with the project’s roadmap plans for “Phase 3” and “Phase 4” as a good plan to enhance the WordPress experience for developers, creators, and publishers alike.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While about one-third of respondents indicated they contribute to the WordPress project, only about half knew how to get involved, knew about WordCamps and meetups, understood the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com, and knew the benefits of open source.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Of 22 topics, the distribution of the top three things that WordPress needs to focus on from the perspective of contributors was broad, with only a 13.5% raw percentage point (1350 basis points) difference between performance (18.6%) in first position and collaborative editing (5.1%) in 22nd position. This shows a need for more consensus among contributors regarding where to focus resources and/or illustrates that the project has many essential elements with passionate supporters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fewer contributors had a positive experience in 2023 (55%) versus 2022 (64%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Similarly, the feeling of being welcome in the WordPress community among contributors decreased to 57% versus 64% in 2022.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Furthermore, contributors feel appropriately recognized less in 2023 (46%) than in 2022 (51%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bringing it all together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 annual WordPress survey participation and results highlight the possibility of survey burnout within the WordPress community and some declining overall satisfaction among contributors. There is an opportunity to increase awareness regarding critical initiatives such as WordCamps and other resources for WordPress users and contributors alike and to increase messaging on improvements made within the project to the CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s planned for 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next iteration of the survey, the plan is to improve the survey’s questions further to ensure they continue to provide valuable insight into the project’s trends. This means some questions will be replaced while others might be refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, plans are being explored to distribute and promote the survey at each of the three annual flagship WordCamps (Europe, U.S., and Asia). This would be in contrast to a single yearly survey. More exploration on this topic will take place in the months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2024/02/2023-WordPress-Annual-Survey-Results-Deck.pdf\">View the 2023 Slide Deck</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://reporting.alchemer.com/r/738278_655bbaa5598b14.93675163\">View a web-based version of the results.</a> <em>Note that this link may expire in the future.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>*<a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/net-promoter-score-calculation\">What is NPS?</a> Simply put, NPS is a KPI organizations can use to measure how likely it’s [users, clients, members] are to recommend a product or service.

Plugins like Advanced Custom Fields have a pretty passionate fanbase, so it shouldn’t be a surprise the WP Engine’s employees are just as passionate about their products too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that passion goes on full display every year when WP Engine hosts DE{CODE}, their popular developer conference, now in its fifth year. DE{CODE} 2024 will happen March 19th &amp; 21st, with the one-day-long agenda repeated across three global regions. The online conference is free to attend, and <a href=\"https://events.wpengine.com/event/f5972890-64b0-4934-9b39-2e704bf34725/websitePage:7b184ebe-3411-489f-bc0c-f76fe90d1ce5\">registration is now open</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I connected with some of the team members behind the conference, and behind WP Engine’s products, to get a (quite candid) behind-the-scenes look at what many would consider a fairly unique approach to a conference in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Giving Tech Conference Vibes&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the tech industry more broadly, the idea of a company-centric conference is pretty standard fare. I’m sure your inbox is full of invitations from AWS re:Invent and Stripe Sessions, though I think a more apt comparison might be something like <a href=\"https://conference.convertkit.com/\">Craft + Commerce by Convert Kit</a>. In the WordPress community, it’s not as common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lexi Mostek is the Lead Event Manager at WP Engine helping to bring this vision to life. I asked her about the background of the event and how they think about the balance between company and community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We started this virtual event before Covid even existed,” she told me, “because developers a lot of times don&#8217;t have the budget to travel and we don&#8217;t want to charge for this event. We want to make it free. We definitely started out heavily promoting a lot of our own products and having a lot of internal speakers, which I think you can expect from a company putting on a conference. What we have tried to do is grow our roster of other people in the community, other speakers and other topics that support that. So I think we just added on our 46th speaker. And roughly half of those are external.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is WordPress after all, so I’ll be clear now that this is not a WordCamp. That said, alongside WP Engine product updates and tutorials, you’ll get to hear about WordPress 6.5 from the core Editor Triage Release Team and about AI from Zack Kass, the former Head of Go-to-market at Open AI. If it’s anything like years past, the sessions don’t feel like a sales pitch, they more often take the shape of hands-on tutorials and best practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Stinson is a Product Marketing Manager at WP Engine whose domain includes Local, Advanced Custom Fields, and many of the other developer tools they’ve added from deals <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-5-plugins-from-delicious-brains\">like 2022’s acquisition of plugins from Delicious Brains</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“One of the sessions I’m involved in is an ACF Blocks deep dive,” said Rob. “We&#8217;ve seen this feature really emerge as a hero of ACF over the last few years and we&#8217;re doing more and more in the product itself to improve that feature set. So myself and Liam Glady (Senior Engineer at ACF) will go through four different custom blocks, the first one being a very basic one to showcase the nuts and bolts of it for anyone who is not familiar with how to do custom blocks with ACF. But then we sort of progress and showcase some more interesting ideas that really leverage interesting features.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sort of practical approach is key to many of the sessions. For WP Engine, the return on their investment into the conference comes by being seen as the hosting company who is most focused on providing value to developers. The goal is brand awareness more than immediate conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“WP Engine obviously has a long history in the Managed WordPress space,” he said, “offering WordPress solutions at scale. Something that we have learned &#8211; and it does seem obvious when you&#8217;re in the midst of it &#8211; is providing value through developer and builder tooling is just immensely impactful. There’s value to our customers and there’s value for the broader WordPress ecosystem.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly being the company behind WordPress’ most popular local development tool is helpful, otherwise Automattic wouldn’t be <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-doubles-down-on-the-developer-community\">bringing their own competitor to market</a>. Even outside of WordPress, you can see other open source platforms working to own the comprehensive developer experience, from coding to deployment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Most Unusual Format</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting feature of DE{CODE} is that the conference is streamed live, but sessions are all pre-recorded and presumably polished ahead of time. Then the conference happens &#8220;live&#8221; three times in three distinct time zones, making it more accessible to a global audience. One side effect of this approach is that the speakers and panelists are often in the live chat engaging with the audience and answering questions during their own talks. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve really seen this approach before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imran Pervez, the Global Head of Event Marketing at WP Engine, talked to me about the thinking behind this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When I go to a conference,” he said, “I personally don&#8217;t enjoy watching a thirty-minute session with only a 5 or 10-minute Q &amp; A at the end. That’s hardly enough time for a meaningful discussion. So with the approach we take, if a session is 40-minutes long, you can be asking Q &amp; A the whole time and make full use of the subject matter experts. If a speaker isn&#8217;t able to attend a session–given the range of timezones we’re serving–then we have a mix of subject matter experts per session on hand to interact and respond on chat.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time I attended this conference, I was definitely confused that the person on the screen was also responding to me in the live chat, but I have to admit it really makes for a more collaborative experience as an attendee. It&#8217;s one of the more engaging live chats I&#8217;ve seen at a virtual conference, and conversations can continue on in virtual “hallways” between sessions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">AI is Kind of a Big Deal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The keynotes of the event, as you’d expect in the Year of our Lord 2024, center around AI. Before you wind up that massive eye roll, it is worth thinking about AI in the context of WordPress and maybe looking at some of the names on those panels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob drew the connection between generative AI today and the WordPress landscape:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you think about the last 24 months, you know, AI has become a thing, right? The three areas where the best use cases have emerged are code, text, and images. Interestingly, the best technical representation of those three things in the world is actually WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would add a fourth dimension to AI’s current skillset, which is finding answers from massive amounts of content. In other words: search. If you&#8217;ve been responsible for a large-scale WordPress site or WooCommerce store, then you might know how tricky it is to get search right. But &#8220;search&#8221; as an internet concept has been evolving this last year as AI tools are changing the game, both around data indexing as well as user interface expectations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so it&#8217;s just interesting and exciting,” he continued, “to see the broader WordPress ecosystem figure this out. Ask ourselves ‘What does this look like?’ Experiment with things. As these use cases are evolving and starting to mature, I think the implementation of AI through WordPress in the coming 12 months, 24 months is going to be really impactful.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that does sound interesting, there are a number of AI sessions, including one on AI search, the Zack Kass keynote mentioned above, and another keynote panel featuring Jason Cohen, WP Engine’s founder with a group of notable community members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What we decided to do with our keynote,” Lexi explained, “is bring in some external people like Amber Hinds, David Dicamillo and Lucky Gobindram, who are doing things and actively working on WordPress projects in different areas of expertise. Because this conference isn&#8217;t only about us and our products, it&#8217;s about the community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s interesting agency teams and product owners throughout the agenda. The third keynote panel focuses on the business of WordPress and includes Sujay Pawar of Brainstorm Force, Miriam Schwab of Elementor, and Lesley Sim of Newsletter Glue. Beyond business and AI, there are sessions covering marketing, performance, SEO, and ecommerce.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More than WordPress &#8220;Developers&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the topics listed, you might be wondering why it’s called a “developer conference.” In the WordPress ecosystem, we can often take a broad view on who we consider developers. More than just developers, WordPress is a community of builders and extenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is developers,” Imran said, “but actually it&#8217;s those that have a technical interest in what&#8217;s happening.

For example, you saw me writing about <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/you-dont-need-to-know-code-to-build-a-successful-wp-plugin-business\">how small businesses are taking on the big dogs</a>, an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/which-wp-theme-is-best-fun-with-theme-download-stats\">analysis of popular themes on wp.org</a>, and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/certain-wp-form-plugins-make-accessibility-easy\">how plugin shops have integrated accessibility best-practices into their day-to-day jobs</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"emotions-emotions-emotions\">Emotions Emotions Emotions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While I felt very prepared to do the work that would be required, I was unprepared for the whirlwind of emotions that would flood my body during these two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost everyone I spoke with for my articles was exceedingly professional and helpful.&nbsp; In fact, some people went out of their way to help me find sources and to cajole quotes out of people.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, at times my discomfort with waiting for email/Slack responses to my inquiries left me an emotional wreck (“Are they ignoring me? Did I offend them? Were my questions stupid?&#8221; etc.).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there were times I accidentally manufactured discomfort &#8211; like when I pushed to get a straight answer about a difficult topic out of a PR person at a big WP plugin shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was the scary time when an online accessibility forum misunderstood my line of questioning and came after me with pitchforks (for the record, my articles highlight people who are making a positive difference on the accessibility front).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the waves of emotion I experienced are part of starting something new and challenging.&nbsp; I hadn’t written articles with this intensity for decades &#8211; it makes sense that I would be forced to deal with my internal emotional issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-did-i-learn-in-these-2-weeks-of-writing-for-the-tavern\">What did I learn in these 2 weeks of writing for The Tavern?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of weeks writing for The Tavern, I learned so so so much.&nbsp; Here are some of the many lessons I learned since Feb. 29:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>I learned that people appreciate being part of a good yarn. My articles on plugin businesses and people doing great work on web accessibility seemed to be appreciated by both the commenters and the people featured in the articles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned that hitting “Publish” can be scary.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned off-the-record conversations are oftentimes more fun than on-the-record ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Related, I learned that off-the-record conversations build trust that a reporter can leverage into more compelling <em>on</em>-the-record interviews and articles later.&nbsp;<br />For example, one of my off-the-record conversations led me to a curious string about a sensitive topic &#8211; I pulled that string, and before you know it, we agreed to put that part <em>on</em>-the-record and included it in an article.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned the hard way that you’ve got to be careful about how and where you tell people you are a journalist.&nbsp; That lesson cost me a lot of heartburn and sleep.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned that I need to help people help me.&nbsp; One person I interviewed early on asked, “What’s your angle?&nbsp; I want to give you a quote that’s relevant.”&nbsp; That question saved us from a lot wasted of back-and-forth time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned that some people want The Tavern to be hard-hitting “gotcha” news source. <br />(Fwiw, I see The Tavern’s role in the community a little differently &#8211; It needs to be a trusted source of information and a hub for conversation in the WP community.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned (to no surprise) that the writers at The Tavern truly do have the editorial freedom to cover topics that are critical of WP power brokers, including the people paying our paychecks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interacting with the other 6 writers led me to believe that any of us 7 would make great next-generation leaders of The Tavern.&nbsp; Seriously &#8211; I’d trust any of them with leading my beloved Tavern moving forward.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned that reporting on WP stuff is not an easy job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned that the 2-week timeframe was both a positive driver and a limiter of output. Deadline pressure in journalism is real any way you slice it.&nbsp; Deadlines force you to get creative &#8211; to say&nbsp; “good enough”, hit the “Publish” button, and move on to the next challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned that not as many people read The Tavern as I thought.  \n<ul>\n<li>When I told my mom and sisters that I was picked to write for The Tavern, they were like, “Uhh huuuh.&nbsp; That’s nice, sweetie,” and more or less patted me on the head before returning to their respective days. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>I was surprised to learn that even some of the WP pros I quoted in my articles did not check wptavern.com to read the articles.&nbsp; When I spoke with them a week after one article posted, they said, “Oh! Is that article live?”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned that, based on The Tavern’s Jetpack stats, these articles do have an extremely wide reach by my standards.&nbsp; For example, one article I posted has garnered over 2,000 views on the web, over 2,000 email opens, and 70 clicks from email.  (I joked that I had 300 million impressions and 4,070 conversions &#8211; that’s a conversion rate of .0013%.&nbsp; Not great if it was a paid ad campaign, but, personally, I was thrilled with the numbers!)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I learned that constructive criticism I received on my article drafts from my fellow writers made my writing better.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"i-hadn-t-applied-to-a-job-in-decades\">I hadn’t applied to a job in decades.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I found personally fascinating was the application process &#8211; because I have no idea how to apply for a job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last job I applied for was a student life position at the University of Minnesota in 2004. I quit that job in 2006 to become a <a href=\"https://themightymo.com\">WordPress consultant</a>, which has been my primary job since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing for The Tavern is a dream job for me.&nbsp; In my application, I wanted to communicate my vision for the job, my unique life experiences that might make me a great fit, my view that the news is a critical component of our democracy, as well as my quirky personality (didn’t want to surprise anyone there).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My application was a long email highlighting my experiences reporting the news, blogging, and contributing to the WP community.&nbsp; It also mentioned my respect for The Tavern’s history (I’ve been reading The Tavern nearly every day for 10 years or so).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I didn’t hear back after a short amount of time, I got antsy and sent this follow-up:</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hire-me-or-not.jpg\" alt=\"A piece of crumpled up notebook paper with \" />When I didn&#8217;t hear back on my original application after a week, I sent this follow-up email.\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-it-like-working-with-matt\">What is it like working with Matt?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the more popular questions people asked me over the past two weeks was, “What is it like working with Matt Mullenweg?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt was true to his tongue-in-cheek word from <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/whats-next\">his Nov. 2023 post</a>: “You can ask previous writers how much I was in their hair.”&nbsp;&nbsp;I had very few interactions with Matt or the Automattic/Audrey team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt prepared to do the work of The Tavern, and I saw the lack of interactions with Matt as a sign that he trusted me to do that work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like Matt was available via Slack if I needed him, however the only time I needed him was when I needed access to the X.com account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I had read <a href=\"https://scottberkun.com/yearwithoutpants/\">The Year Without Pants</a>, so I was expecting this trusting, hands-off approach to leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, with all that in mind, it was great working with Matt!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-would-i-improve-the-tavern\">How would I improve The Tavern?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a great love in my heart for The Tavern.&nbsp; Regardless of who takes over the reins, I hope they continue to pursue a deeper connection to the WP community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tavern is a hub of our community &#8211; a place where people go to learn and to be heard. The format and history of The Tavern communicate an openness that has proven tough to replicate elsewhere on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, wptavern.com is the humans who write, run, and interact on the website.&nbsp; I hope whoever takes over continues to push those traditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see an opportunity to have the Tavern community provide more input into what gets reported on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see the next leader reimagining the WP Tavern Forums, doing more outreach on other platforms, and looking for other ways to increase engagement on-site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-s-next-for-me\">What’s next for me?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know what’s next.&nbsp; I feel like I could add some very positive and subjective direction to The Tavern based on my unique experiences in the WP community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest, I would love to be involved with The Tavern in any capacity that it needs me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"would-i-do-it-again\">Would I do it again?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a thrilling couple of weeks, and I’ve gone through a rainbow of emotions and learnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would absolutely 100% do it again.&nbsp; And who knows &#8211; maybe you’ll see this smiling face at The Tavern again someday!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-post-author-biography\">Toby Cryns is a freelance CTO, WordPress consultant, and teacher at <a href=\"https://themightymo.com/\">The Mighty Mo!

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how WordPress is managed and directed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash juke box and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha is the executive director of WordPress, a role she&#8217;s held since 2019. She&#8217;s been contributing since 2012, and has a special fondness for brand new to WordPress learners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the episode, Josepha shares her insights on overcoming the challenges posed by the pandemic. She talks about the positive strides made within the Gutenberg project, and the need for improved change management during its implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also explore the significant achievements of WordPress, reflecting on its growth to power 43% of the web. This gets us into the objectives for future WordPress expansion. Despite some current stagnation, Josepha explains her ambition to reach 51% market share. She talks about the potential in the enterprise sector, and the importance of reshaping walled gardens into community gardens. A metaphor for an inclusive and participatory ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discussed the semi anarchic nature of participation in WordPress, acknowledging the diverse perspectives of for profit motives, and those who contribute for nonprofit motives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We contemplate increased diversity and restructured WordPress events, with aspirations of up to 160 word camps a year. And we discuss recent experimentation in the event space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expressing her journey from hands-on community management, to her executive role, Josepha explains her optimism for WordPress, with passion and authenticity. She emphasizes the responsibility of aligning contributions with strategic roadmaps, ensuring that each initiative within WordPress delivers meaningful impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we discuss how the success of WordPress can be measured. This is focused upon metrics like attendance, engagement, and community contributions as a way to gauge the vitality, and sustainability of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the WordPress project as a whole, and how it&#8217;s run and directed this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note, before we begin. This was recorded live at WordCamp Asia. There was quite a lot of background noise to contend with, and I&#8217;ve done my best to make the audio as easy to listen to as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:00] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Hello. How&#8217;s it going, Nathan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very, very good. We&#8217;re in the, I actually don&#8217;t know the name of the venue, but we&#8217;re in the venue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:06] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> I know it by its acronym, which is TICC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. That&#8217;s where we are. We&#8217;re in the media room. It&#8217;s Word Camp Asia. It begins today, we had the contributor day yesterday. As I said at the beginning, I&#8217;m joined by Josepha, but I think probably for the community who don&#8217;t know you, could you just tell us who you are? Give us your bio, what your role is in the WordPress project, because it&#8217;s quite a significant role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:29] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Yeah. I&#8217;ll give you the mini bio, so that we have a little bit of extra space for the what I do, because it is significant. So I&#8217;m Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;m the executive director of the WordPress Project, and I came to this work kind of through marketing and other ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I learned about WordPress in 2000 and like 10, 2011. Made my way, over the course of my career, through marketing, and data analysis strategy, and then wound up here in the WordPress project. I did some community stuff first, and then took over some core work, and then did what I do now, which is as the executive director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what I do as the executive director is I, for one, make sure that all of the bits and pieces, that are working across the project, are kind of aware of each other. It&#8217;s very hard to see how everything is interconnected. But I also make sure that we have some focus and effort around specific projects. Things like making sure we have volunteers coming in, and contributors that are trained, and some way for new attendees to figure out how to learn WordPress, or learn how to contribute, however that goes. And making sure that we have time and attention, funding in the project as a whole. So it&#8217;s a bit project management, it&#8217;s a bit funding and resource management, and quite a bit of strategy as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It really sounds like rather a lot. Do you find yourself working a regular shift? You know, do you begin at nine in the morning, and finish at five at night? Or are you 24/7, having to wake up because people in, for example, Asia are doing things at certain times?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:54] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Yeah, so when I first started doing the work, I would work anytime, and kind of just let my day fill up as it would, because it always does. As we ended up with more contributors, and for my teams at Automattic, as I ended up with more and more people there, it became really clear to me that, like a goldfish, it&#8217;s just going to grow to the size of the container you have for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I do really try now to fit it into set times. And, you know, I&#8217;ll get up early, work a bit late if we have synchronous talks that have to happen. And when I go to WordCamps, I just, you know, work 16 hour days, because that&#8217;s how you do at a WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, for the most part, I really try to make sure that I guard my personal time pretty jealously, and that when I am working, try to make the best use of my time, and everyone&#8217;s time that&#8217;s working with me. Because we all have finite resources in that space. Like, we all have the same number of hours in our day, and my time isn&#8217;t more important than anyone else&#8217;s. And if I consider my time important, I should treat everyone else&#8217;s time as important too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You must have had a great sense of optimism when you began in 2012, to have risen in the way that you did. You must have enjoyed it, threw yourself into it I&#8217;m guessing. Do you still have that same sense of optimism about the project in 2024, that you did in the 2012, 2013, 2014, or is your role, the nature of the role that you have, mean that you view it from a different angle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:14] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> So, to answer the question specifically, to answer that particular question, I do really still have a lot of optimism. Like, there&#8217;s so much that we can do for the project to get it moving faster in specific directions, and kind of get everyone in here and working on it in a way that is impactful for them, but also is valuable to our CMS and our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wouldn&#8217;t say that my career progression was because of optimism, right? Like, I try to be a realist. Pragmatic optimism is kind of how I like to really hone in on that. But I continued to see the need for someone to come and do the work that I am specifically skilled at doing, and also was really prepared to take on the responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t necessarily like, I&#8217;m optimistic, and therefore I will do this forever. It was, I see the importance and the value of having this available, long after any of us want to stop working with it. And so I have the skillset, I have the attention, I have some of the connections, and I accept the responsibility to help move this forward, and keep it moving in a good direction, for as long as they&#8217;re willing to have me. So I guess it was less because of optimism I did, and more of a, because I can accept that kind of responsibility, I will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> At WordCamp Asia you&#8217;re giving a talk, and the title of that talk is converting walled gardens into community gardens. And I&#8217;m just going to read a little bit of the blurb that goes with that. You mentioned the fact that WordPress is this giant CMS, and you say that it&#8217;s grounded, it&#8217;s got an ethic, it&#8217;s got maybe some morals in there. But there&#8217;s obviously some point of concern in your mind, because you say the following, how are we managing our distractions and feeding the opportunities around us? What are the distractions that you are thinking of when you put this talk together? What are the distractions that the community is experiencing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:01] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Yeah so, firstly, I have to acknowledge that sometimes when folks work closely with me, they see that I am highlighting potential risks in a plan. And I never do that because I think that it&#8217;s a bad plan, I do that because I believe, probably, it&#8217;s the right way to go. And if we don&#8217;t know what is in the landscape for us, we can stub our toe on rocks. Like, I&#8217;m just trying to find the rocks we are going to stub our toes on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I do have some questions around that. I think the last time that this came up, this question of what is going to distract us from doing the things that help us move faster, or move better, or be more relevant? It&#8217;s always the question of, are we contributing things that are specifically related to the roadmap?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is, for open source, this basic philosophy of contributors are here to contribute without the expectation of reciprocity, and without an agenda. But I have always really felt like the without an agenda part, is not as nuanced as it should be. Because everybody does have a plan. They&#8217;re trying to do things. Like, people are contributing some functionality, because it fixes a problem they had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that doesn&#8217;t fit with the idea of no agenda. And also, we don&#8217;t want aimless contributions. When you support 43% of the web, it&#8217;s so difficult to move that number of people in any sort of direction. That if people show up with kind of aimless contributions, you aren&#8217;t able to have a clear direction for where the software&#8217;s headed, or the community&#8217;s headed. And it&#8217;s not a good contribution experience either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don&#8217;t feel like they have a clear impact. It&#8217;s not clear how their project gets into the CMS over time, or gets rolled into our event series. And so I just, I don&#8217;t have any concrete examples at the moment, because they will all belong to someone, and I&#8217;m not going to have them experience this on a podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like, you&#8217;ve always got to watch out for those things where, this project that we were working on, it worked really well when TikTok wasn&#8217;t where everyone was. This worked really well when Reddit was in its heyday, or whatever. Like, it was stuff and communication processes, and methods that made sense for the context of the time. And I just want to make sure that everything that we&#8217;re doing makes sense for the context of now, where it&#8217;s reasonably possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, what&#8217;s your guiding principle? What&#8217;s your North Star? Because I&#8217;m guessing that maybe you speak to Matt, Matt Mullenweg. In the pyramid of WordPress and organisation, you are right near the top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where do you get your inspiration, for what the project should be doing? Where do you find that? Do you come up with ideas? Toss them around between the people that you work with? Or is it really a process of getting in the Slack every day, and just listening, and percolating, and filtering the ideas out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it feels like, if WordPress were a blue chip company, and it was a for-profit organisation, you&#8217;d have this hierarchy, wouldn&#8217;t you? And right at the top would be the CEO, and they would make the decisions with the board, and those decisions would then trickle down, and everybody would have to obey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not the way it works. So I&#8217;m genuinely curious. Where do you get your intuitions, as to what we should be doing? And how do you sort of shepherd that conversation, so it doesn&#8217;t feel like, well, we&#8217;re being told what to do, more we&#8217;re being guided, here&#8217;s some things we could do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Yeah. I&#8217;m going to try to answer them sequentially and do my best. And if I get lost, you&#8217;re going to have to bring me back. So the first question you had was, what is my lighthouse? What is it that I&#8217;m aiming for? So I do kind of have this dream of like WordPress being the thing that secures the future of the open web. And it is literally a dream, because we actually don&#8217;t have that much agency. Like we, even if we get to 51% of the web, will not actually have the ability to just say, and now the open web is here forever. Like, that&#8217;s not within our control. So it is a bit of a dream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is, for me and my decision making, an overarching vision of what we can offer as a project. And a lot of my decisions are based on that. So I believe that the WordPress project and ecosystem should be able to offer an excellent open source alternative to every tool that is required to get a business started online, to get your project started online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that feels attainable, right? Like, the CMS, done. Open source CMSs, in place of proprietary CMSs, that&#8217;s good. But also things like Openverse, and the photo directory, and how that can compete if we figure out a couple of provenance issues, and maybe like micropayments. How that can compete with Getty images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that that&#8217;s a really compelling offer and opportunity, especially because, as people are coming into this community, so much of what they&#8217;re looking for is kind of a more equitable access to a network. To not only succeed at their learning and connection to their local community, but then also to succeed with their business goals, however they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is my guiding principle from just like what we have to do here standpoint. And then there are the philosophical principles that we all kind of hold in the WordPress project, which is the four freedoms of open source, those are in there. The five good faith rules of community that we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we&#8217;ve got the ethical principles that are in there. We have the pragmatic things, like always decisions, not options. And I feel like they all ladder up into this concept of like, we could be the primary open source alternative to make a business happen. To make your dream happen. To make your story known online. So there&#8217;s that. And immediately, I forgot the 17 other questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It was really about what is your North Star, and how do you decide what&#8217;s important?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:23] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Okay, so for one, there are a lot of like literal decision making tools that I use. But I know that&#8217;s not the question you&#8217;re actually asking. The question you&#8217;re asking is, how do I keep track of the information that comes in, and where do I find the best guesses about the future? So that we can choose the right product choices. We can make the right event and ecosystem decisions. And fortunately, I have the incredible good fortune of having my own leadership team inside Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got three people who work directly with me. Héctor Prieto, Chloé Bringmann and Angela Jin, and probably everyone will recognise all three of those names, work with me to help keep track of everything that&#8217;s happening across the ecosystem, and the programs, and the CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are also about 10 people that I really rely on in the community, and they are from across different companies, and different disciplines, they have different roles. We have people who like specialise in product or project management, and people who are core developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so like I have a lot of people who are helping to flag issues, and flag potential future opportunities that I otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have seen. And I rely heavily on them to talk through like, what is the essential pros and cons of this discussion that&#8217;s being had here? What is the relative impact to like performance in the CMS? What&#8217;s the relative impact for attendees, if we make this change versus that change?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I do a lot of discussion with a lot of people and, yeah, it&#8217;s based on like stuff that&#8217;s happening in Slack, and Post Status, and Twitter, and kind of all around. I am just one person, and it has been probably more than a decade since one person could know everything that was going on in WordPress. And so I&#8217;m very lucky to have probably a good collection of 12 to 15 people that are helping me do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you were the CEO of a blue chip company, I&#8217;m guessing that the metric for success would be profitability. Are we in the black? Are we in the red? What did we do to go into the red? What did we do to go into the black? What&#8217;s the guiding principle there? When you look back over the last, let&#8217;s say, couple of years, what do you see as the moments that were successful? You know, it doesn&#8217;t have to be specific, it could be more of a general question in terms of, what does success look like? What are you looking for there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:33] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> It&#8217;s different in different places. So there are kind of four big focuses in the WordPress project. You&#8217;ve got the CMS and related software elements. You have our programs and event series, which are WordCamps, meetups, and then also all of the things that keep volunteers feeling like they are included in our project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have the ecosystem, which is like the marketplaces that we have, with the plugin directory, and the theme directory, things like that. And then we kind of have a fourth that is our communications and operations side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for each four of those, there is a different metric. We don&#8217;t have a lot of early indications. All of what we can look at is primarily just like a result, as we are working through things. And so we can&#8217;t make a lot of early course correction, just because we don&#8217;t. take data for anyone to have WordPress. We have instituted auto updates, and so like we can&#8217;t really follow downloads as a proxy for how many people are using WordPress, like things like that. And so the indications, the metrics, if you want to call them that, are different for different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But ultimately, I really believe that our best proxy for understanding how vital WordPress is to our own ecosystem, is seeing how many people are still trying to learn WordPress. How many people are attending our events? How many people are showing up to help build it? Although that is a very long tail kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can take anywhere from, you know, five months to five years for somebody to go from using WordPress to finally contributing to WordPress. And so that one has a really long latency period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also there are normal things like, how many new followers do we have on our social media channels? How many new users do we have in Slack that are participating actively? How many contributors do we have, as we are just kind of running through our annual milestones of flagship events, or WordCamps overall, or major releases?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a bunch of things. I think that once a year at State of the Word, kind of point all those out. So we don&#8217;t like have dashboards or anything that keeps track of it. But I do have a general sense for where things are over the course of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If we were to go back to 2012, I don&#8217;t know what percentage of the internet was using WordPress, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t 43%. At the moment, 43 ish, thereabouts, 43%. It&#8217;s highly improbable, I would&#8217;ve thought, that looking back 10 years, you would&#8217;ve said approximating half of the internet would be using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s had this really unprecedented growth. Monumental growth. So if you were to look back at any one of those years, probably the numbers tick up each year, and let&#8217;s just use that one metric, the percentage of the internet. Do you have any intuitions as to whether that 43% is in a state of ascendancy still? Are we looking into 2024, 2025, are we looking for it to be 44, 45, 46? Has it plateaued? Is it maybe going down? Do you have any expectations of where the project will be in a year, two years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:20] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> So, for one, one of my big success indicators would be for our percentage to get to 51%. Because that approximates out to like 75% usage, which is a ton. I realise 51% is a really big percent of the web. And it&#8217;s like, you know, eight percentage points away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the question of, are we still growing? Do we expect more growth? Do we expect like incremental, or another big spike? We do. I think we all can see that we currently have a little bit of a plateau. But also, in my big picture goals post for 2024, I called out very specifically, like, I see that this is something that we all kind of started talking about in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the first time that we all sort of had a question around like, is this plateauing? Is it an unlimited plateau? Do we think we can do something to change it? And I do think we can do something to change it. But I also think what has to happen will really take a lot of concerted effort, for two reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one, because in order to do any last mile work, like the last mile of a delivery is always the most expensive. That is going to be our hardest work, to get from 43% to 51%. Just because you have kind of sold to everyone who already knew they needed you, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second part of the problem is that, everyone else that is available to, quote unquote, sell WordPress to, are companies and business deciders, who maybe don&#8217;t know that they need a CMS. Which is a different proposition than companies or business deciders, who know they need a CMS, they know they need a website, they&#8217;re just trying to figure out which one. We can certainly make a strong case for why WordPress is the best long-term solution for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if they don&#8217;t agree that they need a website, or that if they do need a website, that it needs to have enough functionality for them to grow, or whatever reason they have, that&#8217;s a different sales proposition. And getting into that enterprise space, getting into that corporate area, as you mentioned, there&#8217;s a bit of a shift that you have to make in your mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a feeling of open source means everything&#8217;s free, because it says it right there, free and open source software. But free in this context means, you know, about speech, and freedom, and copy left, right? And less about no money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one ever said that you should not be able to make money in an open source project, or using open source software. Like, it is seen all over the internet right now, that you can build a business on top of open source technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that is a big shift in mindset. WordPress has always been very pro business. If you look at our plugins, it&#8217;s not a bunch of plugins that are like, here&#8217;s how you paint on WordPress or something. Like, that&#8217;s not the plugins we have. We have plugins that are like, we want you to be able to convert into your contact form better. We want your contact form to be easier, and more enticing, so that you can have those contacts, so you have the opportunity to pitch your product, or pitch your service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at what we have around, we do want people to accomplish business tasks, on top of any other sort of thing that they&#8217;re wanting to do here. And so I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s as big a shift as we worry that it is. I think it&#8217;s always been there, and we just are a little scared of the idea of it. It feels like we kind of have to lose that original ethos, and I don&#8217;t necessarily know that that&#8217;s the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned in the blurb for your talk, you were talking about distractions, and we covered that off a little bit. But you talk about the sprawling nature of the future of our projects. And I&#8217;ll just quote, in your talk you are going to look at what the sprawling future of the project could be, as we continue to convert walled gardens into community gardens. What do you mean by that? What are the walled gardens that you&#8217;re talking about, and what are the community gardens that you wish to have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> You&#8217;ll have to come to my talk. Nathan! But also, I will give you an elevator pitch of it. So there&#8217;s a concept of walled gardens in technology. It historically, or in recent history anyway, has referred to marketing platforms. And a good proxy for that, if that doesn&#8217;t make immediate sense is, you know, like Facebook, and Instagram, Twitter, things like that. Where the audience is contained in the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so if you enter the platform, you have an audience, and you just have to say compatible things to get the audience to you. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s considered a walled garden right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And community garden is actually not something that people use when they&#8217;re talking about software, but I want us to. And so that is also a big part of my presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a community garden is, you know, in the US it&#8217;s a plot of land, generally in a city, that&#8217;s broken up into smaller pieces, where anyone who&#8217;s in that local community can come and garden in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We call it the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Right. People say that often. But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a very accessible term for anyone anymore. I have found that when we talk about that and we&#8217;re like, people putting sheep in the fields. Like, it&#8217;s a very cute idea, but it&#8217;s not the visual thing, in my experience, hasn&#8217;t kept up with what people understand now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of us might understand a community garden, where you have small plots, you can do your gardening. If there&#8217;s anything left over, the entity, the community that is managing the larger group can redistribute that, and make it available to other people in the community. If that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re trying to do, they can donate it to community food banks, or sell it to other members of the community, and use the proceeds to make better beds in their community garden, or improve the ground that&#8217;s in there, or pay somebody to do administrative work, something like that, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s much more modern, evocative. Like, it has a much more modern experience than taking sheep out to fields. I know that there are still people who take care of sheep, I&#8217;m not saying that. I&#8217;m saying that we probably don&#8217;t have, actually, a bunch of local common grasslands for people to all take their uncommon sheep to, in the one common place. Like, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying. It&#8217;s just a more modern concept, and I think a more understandable concept as a result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If we just put to one side, that the walled garden of Facebook, and the walled garden of all those proprietary platforms, and we just think about our community. What are your feelings in 2024 about how it&#8217;s going? How the WordPress community is going? I mean, we&#8217;re gathered, there&#8217;s probably 2000 or so people at this event. We&#8217;re obviously, all of us, optimistic about WordPress. We probably think about it far more than is healthy for us. We are all really into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s been, over the last few years I&#8217;ve seen posts by various different thought leaders, for a want of a better word, in the WordPress space, about what&#8217;s happening in the community. You know, whether the for-profit motive in the community is kind of undermining the sort of more open source nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t really have a question here, it&#8217;s just more, what are your thoughts about whether the WordPress community is bifurcating, whether we&#8217;ve got this, you know, for-profit, not-for-profit, if it&#8217;s getting shattered? How easy is it to steer that ship?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:06] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Sure, well, for just big picture context, it is worth remembering that open source, as a concept, is semi anarchical. And so like, a little bit, you will always have people who are here for the philosophy, and the ethos, that are like, all money is bad. And I get it. I get it. I understand that concept. But, in my experience, one, it has always been true of every WordPresser I&#8217;ve ever met, that they have, what I believe is a healthy skepticism about major corporations that move in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s not because the corporations are necessarily bad. It&#8217;s not because the folks who are here, doing these individual pieces of work, contributing personally of their time, are necessarily more right than anyone else. It&#8217;s just a thing that takes place, because of the values that we have as open source contributors and philosophers, for lack of a better term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I don&#8217;t think that what we&#8217;re seeing, like I know some of the posts that you&#8217;ve mentioned, where people are like, everybody&#8217;s everywhere, no one&#8217;s in a single direction. I agree. We are lacking a little bit of direction. But I don&#8217;t actually think that it is an unsolvable problem. And I don&#8217;t think that it is a pernicious kind of existential issue. I think it&#8217;s been here for the whole time, and it goes in cycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we have been working our way back out of the incredible lull that we had during Covid, where we had no in-person events, because the best way that we could pull together for each other was to stay apart. Which does not make sense to people in WordPress. We&#8217;re like, no, we&#8217;re together all the time. We&#8217;re shoulder to shoulder, looking at the problem. Don&#8217;t make me stay away from the people I love. Like, this is how we are. I get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming back out of that, the human nature part that your brain enacts to kind of work as a coping mechanism, to make sure that they understand what, from a flight or fight perspective, will hurt them or not, really goes into overdrive when you&#8217;ve spent a lot of time in isolation. It becomes harder and harder to see the people who are definitely like you, and the organisations that are definitely like you, versus those that are not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you look for, because your brain has a negativity bias, because it&#8217;s what keeps you alive. You look for the things that definitely are not the same. Because that is the most important thing to look at, rather than what is definitely the same. And so that&#8217;s why it feels so exacerbated right now, I believe. And this does go in cycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had a little bit of this in 2018, as we were working toward moving Gutenberg into core. And now we have it again here, coming out of Covid. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s unsolvable. It is a big problem. But also, like I know this community is able to see each other as more than that person whose plugin competes with my plugin, or that person who disagreed with me on Trac or GitHub. Like, I know that these people believe in each other more than that. And so, yeah, I see it. I agree. It&#8217;s a problem, we should fix it. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an intractable problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that one of the four things that you have to do is community engagement events, that kind of thing. Has it returned? Obviously we had this lull, the pandemic Are we back to where we were in 2019?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is there any intuition that it will get back to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:17] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Obviously I hope it does. That is a goal. I think that 2019 had our highest number of WordCamps. I think that was 140 in the year. I definitely would like to get back to it. This WordCamp that we&#8217;re at, is the 1999th WordCamp. So the next one that happens, and I don&#8217;t know which one it is off the top of my head. Congratulations, you&#8217;re WordCamp 2000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not back to where it was, just because it takes a long time. Like, we have a flywheel effect, that is broken. And we have a very clear concept of what a good WordPress event is about, and what it&#8217;s like, and how it needs to be organised. And it takes a lot of training to get that done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so like our just consistent pipeline of new organisers, it&#8217;s pretty shallow at the moment, but the team is working on it. Both by kind of diversifying the types of events that we offer to folks, to make them either hyper-local, or very specific to a niche. Or just being clear that like we can have just one track of content, or just one speaker, and then we do this other thing. Like, we&#8217;re trying to diversify those, and really reinvigorate the local communities, especially in our larger cities across the globe. And I think we&#8217;ll get back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have continually, more attendees every month, than we had months prior. And then that goes into every year, more attendees as we go. I, at one point, felt like my goal for the community, as a whole, was to get to like 400 WordCamps in a year. I don&#8217;t think that is a reasonable goal now, because that&#8217;s a lot. It was a lot at the time, I just didn&#8217;t know how to set that goal I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a nice number with two zeros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:52] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Yeah, I was like, that&#8217;s a nice round number, I think I can do that. And, you know, we went from 60 a year to 140, during the time that I was helping to guide that program. So like it seemed plausible, but probably I think a bit too big ultimately. I would like to get us back to 140. I think up to 160 is probably good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think maybe, along with this diversification of events that the community team is working on, we might also want to take a look at how we actually stack up our events. So like we have meetups, WordCamps, regional camps, flagships right now, you know, in a pyramid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just wonder if, based on what attendees need from these events now, we might need to look at something a little bit different. Whether it&#8217;s meetups and then WordCamps that are specific and niche, and then regional WordCamps and a single flagship. Or if we want to have smaller numbers of meetups, and anything that has a clear shared topic. We make those into hybrid WordCamps, and then continue up in there. I have a lot of thoughts about the fact that we have attendees that still need us, and still need what we are offering, just not in the same proportions that we have been offering it up until this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It sounds like experimentation is the goal for the next period, with events in particular. Play with events, come up with different ideas. It&#8217;s a bit like throwing spaghetti at the wall, see what sticks, try something out. And at this event, we have this notion of invited speakers, which is of interesting and new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:19] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Well that&#8217;s always been around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:20] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> A lot of people don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think maybe it was the magnitude of some of the names that I saw, you know, people who have fame and familiarity outside of the WordPress space, such that it could almost attract people in, just because they&#8217;re on the roster. Thought that was quite an interesting idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But nevertheless, the idea is to experiment with different things inside of events, and see what works, and keep doing more of those. But it does sound like you&#8217;re optimistic. It does sound like it&#8217;s crept up. And whilst it might not be what it was in 2019, it&#8217;s going in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:49] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Yeah. And had you asked me this a year ago, the answer would&#8217;ve been different. So I was still optimistic, because I believe in the strength of a good meaning group of people, like a good hearted group, which WordPressers generally are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it still would&#8217;ve been optimistic. But we had actually not, I feel, gotten to kind of a critical mass. We hadn&#8217;t gotten through the hardest part of the work, at this time last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until, I think it was probably a month a WordCamp Europe last year, where I felt like, okay, we have done enough of the foundational work that the flywheel effect can start to take place again. And so that obviously requires a bit of a shift in the way that folks who are working on building the community, and managing the community events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It requires a little bit of a change in how you see those events functioning in the ecosystem. I&#8217;m absolutely optimistic. I think that we have gotten past the hardest part of rebuilding, which is making sure that your foundations are right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. The next two questions are retrospective. I want you to look back in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:49] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Those are better than predicting the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Then we get to that, I&#8217;m afraid. If we were to look back over, let&#8217;s just pick a number. Let&#8217;s go for five years. If we were to look back over the last five years, what&#8217;s made you happy about what&#8217;s happened in WordPress? So that could be the code, it could be the community, it could be anything you like. And also, what do you wish had been done differently? So let&#8217;s look back. What makes you happy? What do you wish had happened in a different way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:10] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> So something that has made me happy in that timeframe, is that the bet that we placed on Gutenberg seems to have really paid off. Like, we went from 23% to 43%, in that time span. And I know that I was very anxious about the Gutenberg project. I didn&#8217;t talk, I fought full throatedly with Matías about the best ways forward on it, and if we were fully considering the user in the way that WordPress wants to, and should do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he and I really got in the trenches on that, for all of 2017 and 2018, it feels like. And the bet of, for such a dramatic change, bringing in more people than we otherwise would have. I wanted it to be true, and I was experimenting with a full and confident heart, but also my brain was very concerned about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in the last five years, I am so glad that all of the work that we put into, not only making sure that the software that we were building was valuable for people who want to use WordPress, but also that the work that we did to communicate around it, and bring the community with us, worked. Because if we had not really committed to the change, you can sabotage anything by just not doing something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so my teams at Automattic, and then also the contributors in the WordPress project, just came with us on this with, I wouldn&#8217;t say gleeful abandon, that is not what they did. But certainly with the sort of critical feedback, that implies they believe that it could be possible. They saw that there was a possibility there. And so that&#8217;s my favorite thing that happened, in the last five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I wish would&#8217;ve gone better is, I wish that we had done some of that change management work earlier. We ended up, for most of 2019, and I think this may be at the top of 2019, is when I first met you, at WordCamp London potentially. And I specifically went there, I spent the first six months of 2019 traveling to the communities that had told us that we had created the most chaos with merging Gutenberg. And just having y&#8217;all tell me what you hated the most about everything. And almost always the answer was, you might be right about the future of this software, and why Gutenberg needs to exist, and I just wish you had done it in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s what I wish we had done differently, is to do a bit better change management. Because all change, whether it&#8217;s a good change or not, represents a loss. And so if you cannot say at the start, this is great for where we are, but it&#8217;s not going to get us into the future. I think this is why we have to leave this point, and then I believe that this is probably the next point that we&#8217;re going to, help me find the way there. If you haven&#8217;t said very clearly, and with lots of confidence, why today won&#8217;t get us to tomorrow, you&#8217;re not going to get people to comfortably come with you into tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did do that work, and it was a lot of work. A number of contributors in Automattic, and in WordPress, and in other sponsoring companies, put in so much effort into training, and communications, and mediation, and just like listening. And I think that we could have done a little bit less of that, if we had done a little more proactive work, and just letting everybody know why we felt like WordPress needed to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. If everybody working in the WordPress community was an employee, then you could distribute the memo, couldn&#8217;t you? You could just say, this is the intention, off we go. But you&#8217;ve got this massive diaspora. And some of the people, you know, some of them are paying incredible attention to everything that is going on. Other people are just, oh look, it&#8217;s been updated, I wasn&#8217;t anticipating that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think about it a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, the whole project, but Gutenberg in particular. And it feels like now that we&#8217;re in 2024, it felt like there were just one or two pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. And we knew that there was going to be this complete puzzle. But now it&#8217;s got a little bit more fleshed out. The communication got better. Most people seem to be on board. Everybody can anticipate what power behind it is. And I feel very confident that that was the right decision. I think you&#8217;re right, it was hard to communicate all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, we won&#8217;t stare five years into the future. Let&#8217;s go for a year, because that&#8217;s enough. What are you excited about over the next year in WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:29] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> So, this is going to be back office excitement. This feels like the year that WordPress, and its community, is going to like get really aligned on what we&#8217;re trying to do. Like, I feel as though we have enough people in the community, and enough really big voices in the community saying, we need to all just get pointed in the right direction, and everybody row in that direction. There&#8217;s a lighthouse, don&#8217;t hit the rocks. We&#8217;re going to do the thing. Like, we have enough people that are all saying that we really need to band together on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we&#8217;re going to be able to get that done this year. And I don&#8217;t really know what that looks like. But I do, especially like in this particular event, hearing the contributors, and how excited they are. And we had like 75% new contributors. I thought they said 35%, but everybody keeps telling me I misheard, and it&#8217;s 75.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, 75% new contributors. These are people who have never cared to come and do this, either because they didn&#8217;t know that the community existed, or because they were busy trying to get their own businesses set up, so that they had the luxury to contribute some time to WordPress. For whatever reason, regardless, 35% is also a giant number. 75 is enormous, but 35 is really big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hearing the excitement that people have around what they could do, if they understood what our goals need to be. People want to see the direction they&#8217;re supposed to be headed in, and that WordPress is supposed to be headed in, so that we can make sure that it goes a bit further, a bit faster. And I love seeing that because I agree. We would love to go a bit further, a bit faster, and see what is around the corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You genuinely sound incredibly optimistic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:58] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> And here I am saying I&#8217;m a pragmatic realist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s really not coming from a point of, you know, I don&#8217;t get the sense from you, that you are saying this because it&#8217;s a trope that you&#8217;ve got to give me. I feel that you passionately believe everything that you&#8217;ve just said. It&#8217;s an important piece of work that you&#8217;re doing. You are completely aligned with it. You sound like you&#8217;ve got real optimism for the future. That&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:17] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> I&#8217;ll give you a secret. And it&#8217;s a thing that I wish I could tell everybody, and so hopefully you have all of the WordPress project listening to this podcast. So, you know, you&#8217;ve got a task. So I cannot pull together enough words to express how much I care about this community, and what they want to be able to do with a software like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 years ago, I did not understand what a software like this means. I was just like, someone, quote unquote, someone out there is giving away a whole software for free, neat. I didn&#8217;t get it. And the more and more that I learned about it, the more and more that I just, it&#8217;s so much more than any one of us. Which is an amazing thing to be able to say about a piece of software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I moved from, in 2015, to my role of managing meetups, which is what I was hired to do, all the way to 2019, when I became the executive director, and then also became the leader of the open source division at Automattic, my work changed so much in that one moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the thing that I hate the most, is that I think that our community of contributors, and especially the ones that are not just replete with hours to contribute to WordPress. I hate so much that they will never know how much I care about their success. That was always my favorite thing when I was working with events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see people come back year after year, and not only be like, Josepha, I took the advice that I got at this event last year, and look, I have my business up, this thing is thriving. Not only be able to come back year after year, and like be able to celebrate what they enacted, with what they learned the year prior. But then also, to be able to say, at some point, I have all of this success, because of what this community does. And so now I&#8217;m going to be part of that community, so other people can have that success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those were my favourite, favourite, parts. And I miss working with events all the time, giving presentations to help people learn how to do this better. Whether this is like literally blogging, or running a business in WordPress, no matter what. I miss giving people that kind of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I know that I can make a much bigger impact with this work that I have now. And the fact that the way that I have to do my work doesn&#8217;t let me be very clear with everyone that I love their journey. I desperately want them to succeed, and I desperately want them to succeed with WordPress especially, but like open source overall. Like, it really pains me all the time, that people will never know how much I care about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Your enthusiasm is genuinely highly infectious. Amazing. So, we&#8217;ll just round it off. Firstly, for all of the hard work that you&#8217;ve done to get you where you are, thank you for that. In anticipation of all the hard work that you are going to do, over the next few years, again, appreciated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that your job, in many ways, is a thankless task. You know, you&#8217;ve described that you would like to be able to speak to everybody, and reassure them, that&#8217;s not going to be possible. But for what you&#8217;ve managed to tell us over the last half an hour or so, I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:13] <strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy:</strong> Well, thanks for making the time.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha is the Executive Director of WordPress, a role she&#8217;s held since 2019. She&#8217;s been contributing since 2012 and has a special fondness for brand-new-to-WordPress learners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the episode Josepha shares her insights on overcoming the challenges posed by the pandemic. She talks about the positive strides made with the Gutenberg project and the need for improved change management during its implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also explore the significant achievements of WordPress, reflecting on its growth to power 43% of the web. This gets us into the objectives for future WordPress expansion. Despite some current stagnation, Josepha explains her ambition to reach a 51% market share. She talks about the potential in the enterprise sector, and the importance of reshaping &#8216;walled gardens&#8217; into &#8216;community gardens&#8217;, a metaphor for an inclusive and participatory ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss the semi-anarchic nature of participation in WordPress, acknowledging the diverse perspectives of for-profit motives and those who contribute for non-profit motives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We contemplate increased diversity and restructured WordPress events, with aspirations of up to 160 WordCamps a year, and we discuss recent experimentation in the event space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expressing her journey from hands-on community management to her executive role, Josepha explains her optimism for WordPress with passion and authenticity. She emphasises the responsibility of aligning contributions with strategic roadmaps, ensuring that each initiative within WordPress delivers meaningful impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we discuss how the success of WordPress can be measured. This is focussed upon metrics like attendance, engagement, and community contributions as a way to gauge the vitality and sustainability of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in the WordPress project as a whole, and how it’s run and directed, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note. This was recorded live at WordCamp Asia. There was quite a lot of background noise to contend with, and I’ve done my best to make the audio as easy to listen to as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">Openverse</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/\">WordPress Photo Directory</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms\">Four freedoms of open source</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2024/01/19/big-picture-goals-2024/\">Big Picture Goals 2024</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Mar 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"Akismet: 26 Ways to Reduce Form Abandonment and Capture Lost Leads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=283797\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://akismet.com/blog/form-abandonment/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26247:\"<p>Imagine if every single site visitor converted. Every time you led someone to your landing page, they signed up for the free trial. Every time someone clicked through from social media, they made a purchase. How soon could you buy that private island and retire if you decrease form abandonment to&nbsp;zero?</p>\n\n\n<p>A 100% conversion rate is about as realistic as stumbling upon an extra billion dollars in your sofa cushions. But there <em>are </em>things you can do to maximize your results.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People hate filling out CAPTCHAs, for example. They could be <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/burszstein_2010_captcha.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reducing your conversions</a> by as much as 40%. For most marketing campaigns, that’s way more than the difference between winning and losing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>But CAPTCHAs are just one of dozens of reasons why people look at forms and even begin to fill them out, only to end up quitting the&nbsp;process.</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283797\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why form abandonment matters so&nbsp;much</h2>\n\n\n<p>Form abandonment costs you big money. Depending on the purpose of the form, you’re either missing out on a sale now, or missing out on future purchases that person would have made.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, the more traffic or potential customers your company has, the more online form abandonment will cost you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the two overarching reasons most people abandon forms are mistrust and frustration. Either they don’t trust something about your company or the form, or they get frustrated at trying to navigate the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whether you own a relatively new or small business, run a mid-sized company, or are working on a campaign for a large multinational company, reducing form abandonment by even a few percentage points can result in big revenue that you would have otherwise missed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Use the checklist below to reduce your form abandonment rate. Do the easy ones first if you need to tackle a lot of these ideas. Or, if you’ve been at this for a while, scan through the list and find the one or two ideas you haven’t yet implemented, and get your form abandonment rate to tick down just a little bit&nbsp;more.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Proven ways to reduce form&nbsp;abandonment</h2>\n\n\n<p>Yes, your company is unique. Nobody does <em>it </em>quite like you. But the principles of high-converting lead generation forms are fairly universal. Review the list below and choose a few to implement today for a better tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Keep forms simple and&nbsp;short</h3>\n\n\n<p>Only ask for information you need right now. You may want more information for future marketing purposes, but you can find other ways to collect some of that later. Focus on the most essential and critical information related to the purpose of each individual form. That might just be a first name and an email. It might include a location. It could also include something that allows you to segment your audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Break longer forms into multiple&nbsp;steps</h3>\n\n<p>For longer forms, especially surveys and forms related to making a purchase or registering for an event, you’ll do better by turning one long form into several smaller forms with fewer steps on each screen. This makes the process seem faster, and it’s much easier to navigate on mobile&nbsp;devices.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/image.png\" alt=\"progress bar on a contact form\" class=\"wp-image-2464\" />\n\n\n<p>This is probably the primary reason why <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-email-lead-capture\">HubSpot reports</a> that multistep forms convert 87% better than single step forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Place your forms above the&nbsp;fold</h3>\n\n\n<p>If the primary goal of a particular web page is to get people to fill out your form, then don’t bury it. Make sure the online form appears above the fold and is visible the moment people reach that page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the page has a lot of content, include the same form again either at the end of the page, in the middle, in the sidebar, or in multiple places.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Avoid CAPTCHAs (and reCAPTCHAs) at all&nbsp;costs</h3>\n\n<p>If form abandonment was a living, breathing monster, its favorite snack would be CAPTCHA. What is CAPTCHA? You’ve certainly encountered it yourself. It’s a little annoying puzzle you have to fill out before the website you’re on will let you complete the&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/image-1.png\" alt=\"example of a CAPTCHA\" class=\"wp-image-2465\" /><em>Photo from </em><a href=\"http://www.captcha.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>http://www.captcha.net/</em></a>\n\n\n\n<p>A CAPTCHA might require you to decipher a word that’s very hard to read. reCAPTCHAs usually ask you to do something like pick out all the images with bicycles or stoplights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, no one on Earth likes puzzling through CAPTCHAs. They’re a chore we loathe. And that’s why, as mentioned at the outset, CAPTCHAs lead to a high form abandonment rate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a lot of cases, people don’t even try to complete the puzzles. They see a barrier and instantly surrender.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, CAPTCHA is a form completion destroyer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Prefer non&#8209;intrusive spam&nbsp;protection</h3>\n\n<p>CAPTCHAs cause major issues for your users (and your bottom line). But they also stop spam, and you don’t want that, either. Otherwise, you’ll add hours of work for someone in your organization (possibly an entire full time team) who has to sort through that mess each&nbsp;week.</p>\n\n<p>The solution?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a>.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/image-2.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the text \" />\n\n\n<p>This program stops spammers from filling out your forms but without the frustrating CAPTCHA. Using advanced AI and an enormous database of experience, Akismet works in the background of your site to identify and block spammers and bots from completing your&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n\n<p>Your users don’t even know it’s there. They just get to enjoy completing your forms without stress or frustration. That means more conversions, less form abandonment, and higher revenue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For large companies, there’s an <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">enterprise solution for Akismet</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Aim for fast load&nbsp;times</h3>\n\n\n<p>Slow websites drive people away. You have mere seconds to keep them from abandoning the page — especially on mobile devices. Forms are no different; They’re part of the page, and they need to work quickly. Don’t clutter up the page with oversized images or other features that slow things down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Use a free service like <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PageSpeed Insights</a> to enter your URL and see if there are any ways to speed up the loading of your pages that include forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/image-3.png\" alt=\"core web vitals assessment for akismet.com\" class=\"wp-image-2467\" />\n\n\n<p>Using WordPress? A tool like <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/boost/\">Jetpack Boost</a> could provide a major lift with almost no&nbsp;effort.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Optimize for mobile&nbsp;devices</h3>\n\n\n<p>When filling out a form, mobile devices aren’t as easy to use as a desktop or laptop computer. So you need to make accommodations. Other items on this list will help you optimize for mobile technology, such as single column forms and multistep forms. But don’t forget font size and readability, either. On the much smaller screen, it needs to be easy to read the field labels and button copy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Add security badges and trust&nbsp;signals</h3>\n\n<p>Trust is getting harder to presume in the online world. Security badges and other trust signals hold significant influence in reassuring people your forms (and your company’s technology) are safe and trustworthy. Do what it takes to obtain a few of these and place them in or around your&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Display social proof&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A great way to reduce form abandonment is to show testimonials and reviews that speak highly of your company. It’s even better if the reviews relate specifically to what the form is promising. Either way, collect some testimonials, star reviews, and screenshots of real customers rating your service or products, and place them around your form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, a primary cause of form abandonment is a lack of trust.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Ensure forms are visually&nbsp;appealing</h3>\n\n\n<p>There are forms that look like they’re from the 1990s, and there are forms that look good. Even using pre-existing templates, it’s very easy to create simple forms that look sharp. If you haven’t updated your form’s appearance for a while, this is an easy item to check off your list.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while you want your form to fit in well with the rest of your site design, you don’t want it to blend in so well that people scroll right past it. Your forms need to stand out so they’re impossible to miss and tempting to complete.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Provide a clear incentive to complete the&nbsp;form</h3>\n\n\n<p>“Join our newsletter!” Even in 2024, you still see this type of copy on so many email signup forms. The question is — why? Why should we join your list? Why do we want the free download? What value am I receiving? Should I give you my spam email address or the one I actually use?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you need to quickly, and clearly, explain why someone should register for your event. What’s in it for them? Why should they sign up for a webinar, or start a free trial, or fill out a survey?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Your form is the closer. The visitor is looking at your website, your offer, and your form. They’re considering filling it out. But the form itself owns the task of convincing them to follow through and actually do it. So give them a good reason to do so. Make an appealing, irresistible offer or incentive that takes away whatever resistance may still be holding them back — and include it in the form copy&nbsp;itself.</p>\n\n\n<p>That incentive is what will motivate them to follow through and complete the form, and not abandon it halfway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Use engaging microcopy around&nbsp;forms</h3>\n\n\n<p>Likewise, use engaging sales copy in and around the form. Restate the offer. State something about what they can expect after completing the form. Tell them what they get — something good that happens after they finish filling it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Provide live chat support on form&nbsp;pages</h3>\n\n<p>If someone runs into a technical issue, a live chat option may be able to keep them from abandoning the form. This will capture people who really do want to fill out the online form but are having a little trouble. It will also capture anyone who has questions they need answered before completing the&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Arrange fields in a single column&nbsp;layout</h3>\n\n<p>This has been tested numerous times for many years, and the verdict is in. In one study, <a href=\"https://www.foxit.com/blog/elements-of-good-form-design-single-column-beats-multi-column-forms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">users completed</a> the single column form 15.4 seconds faster than the multi&#8209;column form. That’s quite a difference. Many other tests have confirmed that single column forms convert better. And again, with the advent of mobile, the preference for single column forms is essentially a non&#8209;issue. There is no other reasonable way to do&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. Ensure all fields are uniformly&nbsp;styled</h3>\n\n\n<p>This is a trust issue. Make sure you’re using the same font color, size, and type across your form fields. You can use different traits for the form title if you want to draw attention to it. But the fields need to have a consistent design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">16. Clearly label each&nbsp;field</h3>\n\n\n<p>You can put field labels next to the field, above the field, within the field, or perhaps below it. Whichever approach you choose, make sure it is clear and easy to read and navigate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">17 Indicate mandatory&nbsp;fields</h3>\n\n<p>This is another easy one. By now, most people are familiar with the idea of mandatory fields. This feature adds a little star next to the required fields. People appreciate this because then they know which ones they have to fill out, and which ones are optional. Plus, they won’t get upset about all the information you’re asking for if only some of it is&nbsp;required.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to collect more information from people but don’t want to overburden them with a long form, using mandatory and optional fields strikes a good balance. For people willing to fill out every field, you’ll have more information about those customers. For people who just want to complete it and move on and don’t want to share certain information, they will do just the minimum — as long as you tell them which fields are&nbsp;mandatory.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">18. Limit dropdown&nbsp;fields</h3>\n\n\n<p>Dropdown fields add steps to the process of filling out a form. With a dropdown, you have to click and interact differently than with text-based fields. Plus, you have to scan the choices. There’s more to do, and more to think about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>If you have a dropdown menu you feel you really need, it’s okay to use it. But there shouldn’t be more than one of these in most forms. And even if you feel like you need one, can you collect the same information with radio buttons or checkboxes? This is a user experience&nbsp;issue.</p>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/image-4.png\" alt=\"WooCommerce form with checkboxes and short fields\" class=\"wp-image-2468\" />\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">19. Provide real&#8209;time inline&nbsp;validation</h3>\n\n\n<p>One of the most frustrating experiences when it comes to filling out forms is getting to the end, clicking the button, and then learning you made a mistake, and all the information you entered vanishes. You have to start over.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can (and certainly should) set up your forms to not cause entered data to disappear, an even better approach is to use real-time inline validation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means the form itself tells the user they haven’t entered something correctly, or that they missed a mandatory field. For example, they might enter the date using an incorrect format, or an email address missing the ‘@’ symbol or that says ‘cm’ instead of ‘com’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With real-time validation, users will know they made a mistake and can easily fix it before clicking the button. This validation can also show up after they click so they can quickly find their mistakes. But users appreciate it most if it operates while they’re filling it out the first time. Making them go back up and find a mistake increases the risk of form abandonment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Real&#8209;time inline validation is one of the best strategies for improving form abandonment&nbsp;rates.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">20. Use autofill where&nbsp;possible</h3>\n\n\n<p>With some data, autofill can greatly accelerate the process of filling out a form. This can help with email addresses by filling in the ending such as “@yahoo.com”. It can also help with dates in some cases, as well as other fields. For people who have visited your site previously, even some of their personal information can autofill.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast is good. And autofill makes the process of filling out forms much faster and less tedious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">21. Pre&#8209;select common options to reduce&nbsp;friction</h3>\n\n\n<p>Depending on the purpose and specifics of your form, you may be able to pre-select certain items or options that most people choose. That way, most people will have one less item to fill out to complete your form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to be careful with this one, though. You don’t want to pre-select things that relate to money. Some entities offering monthly subscriptions have been known to pre-select the monthly option over the one-time purchase option. Needless to say, customers don’t appreciate finding out on their credit card statement that they accidentally signed up for a recurring charge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So only use this strategy if there is something in your online form that is benign, and that most people tend to select or type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">22. Show or hide fields based on user responses (conditional&nbsp;logic)</h3>\n\n\n<p>Some forms include fields that only apply depending on what a user selects earlier in the form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, suppose you have an event registration form, and one of the items lets the user choose between three different meal options. Then, it asks if they have any food allergies, and includes a list of allergies they can choose. If a user says they do not have any allergies, you can make the form hide the allergy selection field, and thus simplify the form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>In other cases, you might expand the form to add fields based on user responses. Though this makes the form longer, the user won’t mind because they chose that option, which means they want to supply whatever information it’s asking&nbsp;about.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">23. Show progress indicators for multistep&nbsp;forms</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you’re already using a multistep form or are planning to switch to that type after reading this checklist, look to also add a progress indicator. As the user completes each step in the form, the progress bar shows how much closer they are to finishing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/image-5.png\" alt=\"progress bar on a multistep form\" class=\"wp-image-2469\" />\n\n\n\n<p>People like finishing things. The progress bar serves as a visual motivator and reminder that they are that much closer to finishing the form. It increases their desire to complete the task.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">24. Include a link to your privacy&nbsp;policy</h3>\n\n\n<p>For email opt-in forms, a privacy policy link is often a requirement due to anti-spam laws such as GDPR. So you have to have this for email forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For other forms, while the privacy policy link may not be required, it’s still good practice because it expresses your commitment to respecting the privacy of the data your customers and leads are giving you in this form. You want customers to know they can trust you with their data, and are doing what you can to keep it safe and not share it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does anyone actually read privacy policies? It’s probably rare. But having a policy assures people they can find out what you’ll do with their data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">25. Use motivating button&nbsp;copy</h3>\n\n\n<p>Don’t use button copy that sounds like it was written by a computer. Submit. Enter. No — this is not the language of joy, excitement, interest, or desire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Your button is the final step in the process of filling out a form. Let the user finish on a high note. Make them feel good about sending their information to you. There are various ways to do this with button copy, such&nbsp;as:</p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Emotionally affirm them: “You’re&nbsp;in!”</li>\n\n<li>Personalize it: “Sign me&nbsp;up!”</li>\n\n\n<li>Inject personality or humor that fits your brand: “Fight spam!”&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n<li>Clearly describe what’s about to happen: “Register for&nbsp;webinar”</li>\n\n<li>Remind them of the incentive: “Send my free&nbsp;book!”</li>\n\n<li>Remind them of urgency: “Reserve my&nbsp;spot”</li></ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">26. Regularly A/B test your forms and&nbsp;fields</h3>\n\n\n<p>You can A/B test many of the ways to reduce form abandonment that you see in this checklist.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You can test font type, font color, number of fields, required fields, the effect of dropdown menus, security badges, button copy, multistep vs single&#8209;step, and so many other&nbsp;things.</p>\n\n<p>Set up one version of the page with one form, and another version with the altered form. Give the page enough time to collect a valid set of data, and then examine the results. If you see a notable difference in form conversions or abandonment rates, use the version that performs&nbsp;better.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked&nbsp;questions</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is form&nbsp;abandonment?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Form abandonment happens when a visitor to a website begins to fill out a form, such as an email signup form or a webinar registration form, but then fails to complete it and leaves the page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is reducing form abandonment&nbsp;important?</h3>\n\n\n<p>If users who intended to complete an action on your website end up not doing so because of a preventable reason, you’ve lost whatever revenue that action represents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if someone fills out your email signup form, you can begin sending them email marketing, which may lead to future purchases and revenue for your company. But if they abandon the form, all that potential revenue is lost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can I identify which fields cause users to abandon my&nbsp;form?</h3>\n\n\n<p>You can use form abandonment tracking software to collect data that will reveal how people are engaging your forms, where they’re getting stuck, and when they’re quitting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the best practices for mobile form&nbsp;design?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Single column and multipage forms are much easier to engage on a mobile device than other form types. With a touchscreen, and a much smaller screen, these form designs fit better on the screen and deliver simpler functionality and a better user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional best practices include using large enough fonts to be able to read them on the smaller screen, including the form field labels and button copy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does a multistep form improve conversion&nbsp;rates?</h3>\n\n\n<p>For longer forms, many fields can seem intimidating. multistep forms make the process feel simpler and easier by breaking it up into smaller chunks. Completing each step takes much less time, and the user experiences the positive feelings associated with making progress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some effective incentives for form&nbsp;completion?</h3>\n\n<p>This depends on the purpose of the form. Examples include discounts, free gifts, exclusive invites, access to special information or VIP services, free guides, reports or other information, and time&#8209;limited&nbsp;offers.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does A/B testing improve form&nbsp;performance?</h3>\n\n<p>It’s hard to know how well an online form is performing, or if it could perform better, unless you run an A/B test. Pick one characteristic on the form, such as the button copy, and create two forms with two different versions of the button. With enough data from people encountering these two versions, you’ll see if one version of button copy outperforms the other and improves the form’s conversion rate. You can test just about any feature in your form using this&nbsp;approach.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the best ways to build user trust in a&nbsp;form?</h3>\n\n\n<p>You can build trust in your forms by adding social proof, security badges, and links to your privacy policy, as well as giving the form a clean and consistent appearance and functional technology that works quickly and effortlessly. Having a live chat option also increases trust.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are some common mistakes in form design to&nbsp;avoid?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Don’t use more than one column for your form fields. Don’t make your buttons too small or hard to read. Don’t design the form such that it blends in too well with the rest of the page. And avoid asking for unnecessary information, especially if you make all the fields mandatory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why should CAPTCHA be&nbsp;avoided?</h3>\n\n<p>CAPTCHA greatly depresses form conversion rates and increases form abandonment rates. The struggle and annoyance of trying to solve these puzzles leads a sizable percentage of users to give up and abandon the form. The good news is <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">CAPTCHA alternatives</a>&nbsp;exist.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Akismet, and how can it help reduce form&nbsp;abandonment?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet prevents spammers and bots from filling out your forms, but without requiring the user to do anything or even know it’s happening. Akismet happens in the background, and uses AI to identify when bots and spammers are attempting to complete your forms so it can prevent them from&nbsp;succeeding.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How many websites trust&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>More than 100 million websites are currently using Akismet, and as of this writing, it has prevented over 525,000,000,000 pieces of spam from being submitted through things like forms and comment sections. Global companies such as Microsoft, ConvertKit, and Bluehost trust Akismet to keep bots away without gumming up the user experience with their forms.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Mar 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: The WordPress Training Team’s Big Changes: Learning Pathways and Website Redesign\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=154924\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-training-teams-big-changes-learning-pathways-and-website-redesign\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10504:\"<p>Knowledge and training for WordPress has traditionally been very decentralized. There&#8217;s the official documentation, the developer documentation, the support forums, WordPress.tv, and then the wide array of community blogs, tutorials, and YouTube videos. Resources like documentation and support forums exist to answer questions and explain features, but their purpose is not to teach a person what it means to use WordPress. That&#8217;s the goal of Learn WordPress, managed by the WordPress Training team and living at the easy-to-remember URL <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org\">learn.wordpress.org</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn WordPress has existed in some form for the last decade, but the current iteration was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/learn-wordpress-platform-launches-with-free-courses-workshops-and-lesson-plans\">launched by the training team in 2020</a>, with free workshops and courses offering guided instruction through a number of topics, from basic site customization to block development. Now that three more years of educational content has been published, the team has been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-training-team-seeks-community-feedback-on-learning-pathways\">revisiting the structure of the website</a> itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be honest, if you hit the Learn WordPress home now, finding the right information for your specific needs isn&#8217;t the most intuitive process.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s Jonathan Bossenger, a Developer Educator sponsored by Automattic. He&#8217;s actively involved in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2023/07/07/project-thread-learning-pathways-on-learn-wordpress/\">Learning Pathways</a>, a new initiative launched last fall to address some of these architectural problems by July 2024. We spoke about his team&#8217;s goals with this new project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a Learning Pathway?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Learning Pathways,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;are trying to solve [this problem]: allowing folks who come to Learn WordPress to find the specific content they need, whether they are brand new to WordPress, or have some experience and want to take that experience to whatever the next logical level is for them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, content on the Learn site is organized more like a blog: it shows the newest content first, roughly categorized by concept. To help users find what they need, the new pathways will more effectively categorize courses based on three different types of learners: Users, Developers, and Designers. Then the content for each user type is organized by skill level, starting with Beginner, moving through Intermediate, and then Expert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Under the hood,&#8221; Jonathan explained, &#8220;the learning pathways are essentially courses, they use the same custom data types and quiz/activity functionality that courses currently do. But they are bigger, more encompassing courses, each with multiple modules that have a specific focus, containing one or more lessons to achieve the learning outcomes of that focus.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a developer or a designer coming into WordPress could look at their learning pathway and determine where they want to start: are they a Beginner or are they ready to level up their Advanced skills? Not all of the content has not been created yet, but existing courses are being repurposed and used as the foundation for pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Curating Content for Modern WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a developer who has learned WordPress over the last decade, one concern I had was the sheer amount of knowledge you might need to grapple with. Just from the development side, there&#8217;s PHP, JavaScript, React, and dozens of APIs for everything from adding new settings to interacting with the database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Believe me, as the person spearheading the developer learning pathways, even I was surprised how much there is to dive into,&#8221; Jonathan added. &#8220;So for me personally, I&#8217;m a big fan of building a solid foundation, and then building on top of that. I&#8217;m pretty happy about how the beginner developer learning pathway has turned out, but I can see the future learning pathways we create on top of that being kind of fluid.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This opens the question of just how the team is handling the transition of WordPress through its Gutenberg era, and whether they&#8217;re creating content for &#8220;Classic&#8221; features like shortcodes and widget areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The factor that we are always keeping in mind is that we build those pathways to be about WordPress of today and the future,&#8221; he said, &#8220;not WordPress of the past. So while legacy APIs like the Shortcode API are useful to know about, it&#8217;s more important to teach someone about something like the REST API first, because that&#8217;s a big part of how WordPress works today, and probably for the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to legacy WordPress educational content, there&#8217;s plenty of it around the internet. Hundreds of articles and demo plugins exist to teach you about shortcodes, whereas modern WordPress development is still uncharted territory. That said, Jonathan clarified that Learn WordPress &#8220;is focused more on what&#8217;s fully baked, not what&#8217;s still experimental.&#8221; If you&#8217;re interested in the bleeding edge, he recommends the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/\">WordPress Developer Blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Well-Informed Redesign</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Learning Pathways project also includes a complete redesign of the Learn WordPress site. This new design will use the same visual language and underlying block-based parent theme that we&#8217;ve seen for other recent redesigns, like <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-showcase-powered-by-blocks\">the Showcase</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1280\" height=\"2854\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Landing.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of the new \" />\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1280\" height=\"3456\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Learn-WP-Courses-Landing.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the \" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Managing this entire project is Destiny Kanno, Head of Community Education at Automattic. She told me that her focus is “ensuring that the Training Team and Design Team are in constant collaborative communication [and that] the new Learn site follows modern learning website design principles and UI/UX.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Destiny wasn’t just overseeing a redesign, but an entirely new approach to how educational content is being served, including a shift to making more content available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/wordpress\">YouTube</a> instead of WordPress.tv.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I performed market research of both WordPress-specific and non-WordPress specific learning sites,” she explained. That included sites like WPBeginner, WPMU DEV blog, and WP101 as well as larger learning platforms like Codecademy, Khan Academy, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning. Some of the things she looked at include the types of audiences and the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of those user experience updates require a lot of collaboration not just with design, but with the developer teams as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Technical Challenges</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the complexity of the project is the fact that much of the content is actually multilingual. As of right now, there’s no <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Learn/issues/2231\">multilingual plugin on the site</a>, so the structure of this content has been an issue as the site continues to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At the moment we host many content types,” Destiny told me, “Tutorials, Lesson Plans, and Courses&#8211; each with duplicative resources. When providing localized educational resources, being able to update content at scale is critical. With our move to only have Courses and Lessons going forward (courses are made up of grouped lessons), we are working to reduce duplicative content creation and localized content efforts.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another interesting update could be the inclusion <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Learn/pull/2264\">of interactive code blocks</a> inside of lessons, powered by the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/playground/\">WordPress Playground</a>, a WordPress instance that can run completely inside of your browser. The team behind WordPress Playground is helping address specific requirements around functionality and accessibility with the hopes that their <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/interactive-code-block/\">WordPress Playground Block</a> plugin can power more interactive lessons in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes me most excited about the ongoing redesign of WordPress.org is that they&#8217;re fully committed to using block-based themes, at a scale of content and traffic that&#8217;s pretty overwhelming. If you want to learn more about how important this redesign project is, then check out <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-developer-docs-shows-off-a-new-block-based-redesign\">this recent conversation with Nick Diego</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think you have to agree,” said Jonathan, “the <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/ZKaf6u8mIHkAanluWafXAp/Learn?type=design&node-id=2211-18443&mode=design\">new designs are rather exciting</a>, if you compare them to what we currently have from 2020.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Next Steps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the current pathways only cover three different user types, Jonathan and I mused about other potential pathways they could define in the future, like a &#8220;contributor&#8221; pathway or a &#8220;marketer/SEO&#8221; pathway. WordPress is used by a variety of creators and across large organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a writer myself,&#8221; said Jonathan, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to create a &#8216;WordPress writer learning pathway&#8217;. We could have a module on the basics of WordPress, and then dive into using drafts, scheduling posts, sharing to social, and adding newsletters&#8230;&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, the team will remain focused on three specific Learners: Designer, Developer, and User.

This marks a significant moment for the WordPress community, as it&#8217;s only the second time the annual address is delivered outside of North America. Last year, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/12/state-of-the-word-2023-recap/\">the event</a> took place in Madrid, Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The State of the Word is a highly anticipated annual event at which Matt reflects on achievements, unveils his vision for WordPress&#8217;s future, and offers a peep into the upcoming features and developments. It’s an occasion for WordPress enthusiasts to come together to watch the event live streaming and celebrate their passion for the platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt had this to say about choosing Japan for the event: &#8220;The very first translation of WordPress, before we even had a framework for translating, was Japanese. It was the moment that opened my eyes to the possibility of WordPress being more than just a blogging tool for a few hobbyists speaking English. Almost 20 years later it&#8217;s exciting for Japan to host a State of the Word and really showcase how vibrant their community is. I&#8217;m so impressed with all of the books about WordPress there, the market share we have in that country, and the warmth of the events they do throughout the year.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan is home to an amazing WordPress community. The Japanese community was behind one of the first <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/about/history-of-the-team/\">internationalized versions</a> of WordPress &#8211; a Japanese WordPress site was set up in <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20031205101812/http://wordpress.xwd.jp/\">December 2003</a>, just six months after WordPress was launched.&nbsp; The version originally called “WordPress ME” (WordPress Multilingual Edition) was maintained by a user called Otsukare who made a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/localization-help-needed/\">multilingual edition hack</a>. His post in the Support Forum led to Matt chiming in, “Well the localization code should be rolled into the main release sometime. (Soonish.)”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first WordCamp Tokyo was held in 2008, and subsequent editions were serious crowd-pullers. The adorable WordPress mascot, <a href=\"https://wapu.us/wapuu-history-origin/\">Wapuu</a> originated from the 2009 WordCamp Tokyo after-party. Kazuko Kaneuchi later designed Wapuu as a free gift to the WordPress community in 2011.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holding the event in Tokyo underscores WordPress&#8217;s massive and active user base in Japan and throughout Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update: </strong><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/st810amaze/\">Shusei Toda</a>, a Communication Designer based in Tokyo and one of the organizers of WordCamp Asia 2024 is all excited and shared: “We are happy to have the State of the Word coming to our country, marking a monumental moment for the Japanese WordPress community—one of the oldest global communities dedicated to WordPress. It’s an honor to be the second global host city after Madrid, Spain, underscoring our significant position within the global WordPress community. 82.3% of Japanese websites are powered by WordPress, and this event holds immense importance to our local web developers, bloggers, and digital creatives. Hosting the State of the Word in Japan is not just a testament to our community and also in Asia but also a celebration of the pivotal role WordPress plays in our digital landscape.”</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 11 Mar 2024 21:35:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Automattic Doubles Down on the Developer Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=154828\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-doubles-down-on-the-developer-community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20996:\"<p>There&#8217;s something in the water at Automattic, and I don&#8217;t think it just started with Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://ma.tt/2024/02/samattical/\">samattical</a>&#8220;. The last few months have seen a number of interesting changes across the company and its approach to the broader WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I pull the various threads, it looks to me like Automattic is making a larger strategic pivot towards &#8220;developers&#8221; and “builders” as a target audience, for itself and quite possibly for WordPress. Automattic’s products have traditionally focused on the DIY side of the WordPress market, making tools for bloggers or creators building their own websites. That’s still largely the case, but recently, things have been looking a little different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was able to talk to a handful of people across the company and explore some of these major changes. While I was never given an answer on Automattic’s larger strategy, if such an answer even could be given, I think there’s enough out there to frame some initial thoughts on changes that might affect WordPress (the software) going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Woo Express causes Woo Distress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Matt Mullenweg started his sabbatical, he did so with a tongue-in-cheek blog post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://ma.tt/2024/01/automattics-big-re-org/\">Automattic&#8217;s Big Re-Org</a>&#8220;. While there was no big reorganization, the post did announce that each team inside of Automattic is revisiting its position within the broader ecosystem. Decisions will be made based on whether a team’s goal is to be competitive with the other hosting companies (i.e. WordPress.com, Pressable, WordPress VIP) or to be completely host-agnostic and “Help the Hosts” by growing the ecosystem (WooCommerce and Jetpack).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an interesting distinction because you could certainly make the argument that more tightly coupling the WooCommerce brand to WordPress.com’s hosting infrastructure could be a tactical advantage. In fact, they did make that argument when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-launches-woo-express\">they launched Woo Express </a>a year ago and then rebranded the team behind WooCommerce to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-rebrands-as-woo\">Woo a few months later</a>. A new call-to-action that funneled visitors to WordPress.com hosting plans rather than just the open source software raised more than a few eyebrows in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team was fairly quick to address the criticism, with Woo CEO Paul Maiorana taking in feedback and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmaiorana/status/1719714201378197894\">responding openly to the community</a> on Twitter/X. They’ve since rolled back that specific onboarding funnel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg directly referenced this experience and how it helped lead to these new changes:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The big tension this surfaced was Woo Express, going forward that team is switching under WP.com, and Woo.com will recommend a variety of hosts (like W.org) to get started with Woo. Now people can meet with Paul Maiorana, who leads Woo, or James Grierson, who leads Jetpack, and know they have Help the Hosts cards as their teleological goal.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Woo Express is officially a <em>WordPress.com</em> product, competitive with the “managed WooCommerce” offerings from other hosting companies and treated (more or less) the same when you visit Woo.com. The end result is that Woo/WooCommerce will act more like WordPress.org and not completely favor Automattic’s hosting companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conflict of Disinterest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see how important that separation is, but I can’t help but wonder if a one-click install of a new WooCommerce site wouldn’t have been a much better call-to-action for end users than what they get now: a link to a “<a href=\"https://woo.com/hosting-solutions/\">Hosting Solutions</a>” guide and an additional burden of choice. I’m sure a Shopify-like onboarding experience happening directly on the homepage of Woo.com was a tempting strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not unusual for the owners of an open source project, specifically developer frameworks, to actively promote their own paid solutions. The homepage of <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a> includes a callout to Vercel, <a href=\"https://laravel.com/\">Laravel</a> includes links to products like Forge and Vapor. Those paid products (typically around hosting and deployments) can directly subsidize more contribution to the open source frameworks themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has always held itself to a different standard in this regard, and part of that tension is because of the importance of <em>all of the</em> hosting companies to the broader ecosystem. The fact that I can go to any number of hosts and know that they’ll not only support, but also install WordPress for me is a major reason for the success and ubiquity of the software. As much as the community needs Automattic, it also needs the support, engagement, and contributions from the broader hosting ecosystem, a reminder that much of the WordPress you see in the world does not actually run on Automattic’s infrastructure (more on that later).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It’s Time to Build (on WordPress.com?)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the non-re-org, Matt announced that the WordPress.com user experience was about to change.&nbsp;From his blog post: &#8220;WordPress.com is going to orient itself more towards developers, and have an experience that feels similar to WordPress hosted other places, less Calypso more wp-admin.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If WordPress.com is your only experience of WordPress, then this statement might not make that much sense. If you come from the world of self-hosted WordPress, however, you may know that the WordPress.com experience is wildly different from standard installations. WordPress.com still includes a number of premium upsells inside their version of the WordPress dashboard, including links to buy premium plugins on their <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-plugin-pages-add-download-link-for-using-plugins-on-self-hosted-sites\">parallel plugin directory</a>. It’s been a somewhat controversial and convoluted approach, and you can still browse the WordPress subreddit and find the misconception that you can’t install your own plugins on their platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Asia this past weekend, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOF70YJLC5U&t=1297s\">Matt was asked during a Q&amp;A</a> if he would ever retire the “WordPress.com” brand name entirely to clear up the confusion. Matt momentarily pondered whether this was “an original mistake in setting all of this up” and noted that he’d even considered “moving WordPress.com to wp.com or [&#8230;] trying to get w.com.” He ended the thought experiment pointing back towards these user interface changes coming to his platform to bring it more inline with self-hosted WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reached out to Daniel Bachhuber, the long-time WordPress contributor who was recently tapped by Matt to lead the entire WordPress.com side of the company. I asked Daniel to tell me about this new vision of WordPress.com and who it might be for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“WordPress.com has always been a platform for a variety of users,” he explained. “Over the last year, we’ve added more developer-specific features (staging sites, WP-CLI access, etc.) [&#8230;] Our hosting infrastructure, powered by WP Cloud, is best-in-class, but we need to communicate that better.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From what I’ve heard about some of the upcoming developer features, his team is not kidding around. One tool that’s been quietly pre-announced is <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/\">Studio</a>, a brand new tool to manage your local development environment. You can learn about it on the newly relaunched <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/\">Developer Resources</a> for WordPress.com (not to be confused with the newly relaunched <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/\">Developer Resources</a> for WordPress.org, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-developer-docs-shows-off-a-new-block-based-redesign\">led by a team of mostly Automattic-sponsored contributors</a>, or the newly relaunched <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/\">Developer Resources</a> for WooCommerce that I’ll be getting to later. Do you see where I’m going with this?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The new developer.wordpress.com,” he explained, “is our place to connect with WordPress developers. We want to teach them how to use our developer tools, take advantage of our platform features, and help them achieve the best possible outcomes with their websites.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term “developer” is fairly broad, so I asked how they’re thinking about this new market segment internally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is a really tricky question, in fact! What ‘developer’ actually means is variable based on perspective,” Daniel explained. “Our working definition of ‘developer’ is ‘someone who builds or manages sites for someone else.’ This is inclusive of the freelancer building client sites, agency developer maintaining ecommerce sites, or internal developer working on the backend of a multi-platform publishing system or decoupled site.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has actually held each of those jobs at one point, all I can say is that his team has their work cut out for them. Luckily, WordPress.com does have the infrastructure and the talent to achieve the technical implementation. The much harder part will be establishing this new relationship with the broader WordPress developer community, basically from scratch. That’s where the team at Woo comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WooCommerce Would Like to See You Now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Developer Documentation redesigns are in the air this year, the team at WooCommerce also <a href=\"https://developer.woo.com/2024/01/31/introducing-new-woocommerce-developer-documentation/\">announced a brand new relaunch</a>. More than that, the developer relations team has felt much more publicly engaged, recently resurrecting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/developwoo\">their old Twitter/X account</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jacklyn Biggin is a Developer Advocate at Woo and has been one of the most visible forces for this change. I asked her if this was part of an internal strategy to increase their outreach efforts with the developer community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You’re not imagining things,” she told me. “Woo’s developer community is a huge part of what makes Woo successful, and we want to provide them with as much support as possible. We’re working to improve the feedback loop between the community and the Woo team, and relaunching @DevelopWoo is a small step in that process.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She told me about some of the new things they’re trying, like hosting public GitHub Discussions for new features and having blog comments from developers piped directly into their internal Slack. I also asked her about the new documentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Historically, a lot of Woo’s developer documentation and resources were scattered across the monorepo, merchant documentation, the developer blog, and beyond,” she said. “Centralizing our documentation on our new Woo Developer Docs site aims to fix this. The current site you see isn’t a finished product &#8211; for example, we’re currently midway through migrating the WooCommerce Blocks docs to it &#8211; but we’re now in a position where we’re able to make these incremental improvements.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce Blocks was merged into WooCommerce core at the end of last year, making it possible to manage more of your store inside the block editor, and much of the work behind WooCommerce Blocks has directly influenced <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-block-bindings-api-brings-dynamic-data-to-blocks\">development of core WordPress features</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Docs on Blocks&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If there’s one part of WordPress that’s been the most controversial, and given developers the most grief, it’s the block editor. Previously developers extending WordPress or Woo would achieve most advanced functionality with PHP. The block editor still requires that base knowledge of PHP, but adds the additional complexity of JavaScript and React now to make changes to the user interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WooCommerce moves more of its functionality into the block editor, developers will need to keep up. And the team at Woo has to make sure those developers are motivated to keep up, if they want to continue to see the ecosystem thrive. Woo ultimately relies on the platform effect to remain relevant and attract new users. In general, developers will only build for the block editor if they think it’s being used, but users are waiting for developers to bring full compatibility to third-party plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The shift towards the block editor has been a pretty big change for developers,” she said, “and we’re working hard to provide useful resources. These include informational blog posts, tutorials and docs (note that these will move to the docs site soon). Over in our community Slack, we have a dedicated channel with direct access to the team working on Blocks at Woo, and we’re even hosting Office Hours focused on the new Product Editor next month.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel Bachhuber was quick to point out that emphasis on the block editor as well, telling me that, “it’s really matured in the last couple of years, and we’re excited to see the sites built with it this year. We want WordPress.com to offer the best possible user experience for block theme developers.” It’s an interesting turn of phrase. In theory, block themes shouldn’t need developers, instead offering a “no-code” experience building a WordPress site. If anything, the block editor has raised the expectations and need for developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, it looks like most Woo stores <a href=\"https://storeleads.app/reports/woocommerce#themes\">are running on classic themes</a>, though it makes sense that such a fundamental transformation will simply take a long time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I asked Jacklyn if she saw this shift towards developers more broadly in Automattic, she pointed me towards the changes happening at WordPress.com as well as a completely different side of the company, WP Cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Another Automattic Host&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wp.cloud/\">WP Cloud</a> is Automattic’s completely in-house alternative to AWS or Google Cloud. It’s built specifically for WordPress. It’s the underlying infrastructure of WordPress.com and <a href=\"https://pressable.com/\">Pressable</a>, a managed WordPress host under the Automattic umbrella.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more, I connected with Jess Frick, Director of Operations at Pressable. From the outside, Pressable looks like any other managed host, albeit with a particularly enthusiastic user base. Where WordPress.com traditionally marketed toward the individual user, Jess describes Pressable as “an incredible choice for developers, agencies, and freelancers who want to host multiple WordPress websites – our performance test results and customer reviews speak for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress.com makes moves towards that same user base, it’s worth noting that there are key differences. One big tradeoff with WordPress.com’s hosting offer is its deep integration with Jetpack, which may or may not work with a particular developer’s workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Jetpack integration is one area where I think we will continue to differ,” she explained. “While we’re obviously big fans of Jetpack – especially the security benefits – we understand that some of our customers may have other solutions they prefer instead, so Pressable makes it easy to use it or exclude it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s even more important about Pressable is their license for experimentation towards what the future of managed WordPress hosting might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“One aspect of our role that is possibly becoming more clear to the outside world,” she said, “is our position as Automattic’s hosting lab. We are empowered to build interesting things that other brands can benefit from, and we’re given the freedom to do experiments.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Results of those experiments can make their way to <a href=\"https://wp.cloud/\">WP Cloud</a>.&nbsp;For more context, I’d recommend reading <a href=\"https://pressable.com/blog/what-is-wp-cloud/\">Jess’s recent explainer on WP Cloud</a>, outlining what it is and just how involved Pressable has been with its development.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are both built on WP Cloud,” she explained, “and it is the platform that allows us to provide our hosting services. [&#8230;] We have been using what’s now known as WP Cloud for years before it became a product itself and I don’t see a future where we use something else. It’s truly incredible.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I’ll take one WP Cloud, please</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But WP Cloud isn’t just for Automattic. It’s also slowly becoming available to other partners. Bluehost recently came out as a WP Cloud customer, offering a new cloud hosting tier to their customers. What’s more unusual about this deal is that WordPress.com is <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2024/03/07/wp-cloud-bluehost/\">highlighting Bluehost on their pricing page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a smart way for Automattic to grow revenue by leaning into what they’ve excelled at (infrastructure) while other brands (including their own) handle the marketing and user acquisition. Bluehost was one of the hosting options tied up in the initial launch of Woo Express, and it seems clear that Automattic learned something about how to better position these relationships from that messy process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I asked Jess if she felt a larger shift inside of Automattic, she told me that her “personal view is that this is a natural evolution, with Automattic responding to the needs of the market.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We’re all in this platform together</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s so much more that I would’ve wanted to get into, from WordPress VIP to Jetpack’s “Manage” product for WordPress agencies. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230310000542/https://wordpress.com/\">One year ago</a>, the WordPress.com homepage opened with the tagline “the world’s most popular website builder”. Today it highlights their “lightning-fast hosting”. That’s two completely different visions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of your opinion of Automattic as a company, the fact that they’re in the midst of redefining their place in the broader community is important, especially with their outsized role in contribution to WordPress and their <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-faces-scrutiny-over-ai-access-policy\">alleged content partnerships</a> with AI companies like Midjourney and OpenAI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s always hard to say what’s going on in Matt Mullenweg’s head. The Gutenberg project is in its seventh year and still has two of four phases to go. I don’t know if anyone accurately predicted the scale and direction of the project’s current trajectory back then. In his initial manifesto on the topic, Matt said “<a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/\">We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason</a>”:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Ten years ago, agencies and developers worried that software like WordPress would ruin their business because clients wouldn’t need help updating their sites any more, and would maybe even just start building their own sites. But their worse fears didn’t come true — instead, it created new opportunities for everyone.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a developer, of course my theory is going to be that Automattic is starting to value the third-party developer and agency communities much more than it has in the past. That it sees itself less as a beginner’s version of WordPress, with its own Calypso-flavored interface, and more of the underlying infrastructure that agencies and builders can use to grow WordPress. That perhaps it’s turning to a vision of WordPress and WooCommerce as developer platforms for the internet, taking a role similar to other open source projects and focusing on providing infrastructure rather than competing with Squarespace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s definitely a developer’s dream, an Automattic that fits in with the entire ecosystem, that values the builders, agencies, freelancers, and developers building WordPress websites, that offers its customers the same WordPress experience as the rest of us. Only time will tell where this dream leads.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 11 Mar 2024 21:20:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Brian Coords\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Donncha: Gimme all your cache!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://odd.blog/?p=89590464\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"https://odd.blog/2024/03/11/gimme-all-your-cache/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4480:\"<p>Today saw the release of updates to two plugins I work on.

Jetpack Boost will be a drop-in replacement if you have these features enabled in WP Super Cache:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Simple caching</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Caching Disabled for logged in visitors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Garbage collection set to one hour.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll have to disable WP Super Cache first before trying Boost Cache, as they both rely on the same mechanism to load. Disable Jetpack Boost to go back to WP Super Cache. You can enable Boost again, without using the Cache module, and the two plugins will happily co-exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using it here for the last two weeks, and it has worked flawlessly. I post <a href=\"https://inphotos.org/\">images daily on my photoblog</a>, and they get shared to Mastodon, where the expected deluge of requests from hundreds of servers happens each time. Between <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-boost/\">Jetpack Boost</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-cache/\">WP Rest Cache</a>, my server barely noticed. Just like with WP Super Cache.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If it performs just like WP Super Cache, why should I use <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-boost/\">Boost</a>?&#8221; I hear you asking. For some, you&#8217;ll need the extra features of WP Super Cache, but otherwise, Boost may be just what you need. Apart from the cache, it also has remarkable features that will squash your CSS and JavaScript in various ways that load super quick. Give it a go, and let WP Super Cache handle the cache if you need to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re still here, read on, and I&#8217;ll give you a whirlwind tour.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<img width=\"802\" height=\"593\" src=\"https://odd.blog/files/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-11-at-15.28.07.jpg\" alt=\"The Cache module enabled with the expanded view showing the exceptions textarea and logging checkbox.\" class=\"wp-image-89590468\" /></div>\n\n\n<p>Boost supports an exception list like WP Super Cache does, and logging of activities in a similar, but easier to use way.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://odd.blog/files/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-11-at-15.28.50-1024x356.jpg\" alt=\"Output from the logging feature of the plugin shouwing date, pid, URL and description.\" class=\"wp-image-89590472\" /></div>\n\n\n<p>To simplify caching, only requests by logged out visitors are cached now, but that&#8217;s the recommended way of using WP Super Cache too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers: like WP Super Cache, it also supports the &#8220;DONOTCACHEPAGE&#8221; constant. If you define that while a page is being created, then Jetpack Boost won&#8217;t cache it. If you can enable it before the page loads, then the plugin won&#8217;t serve a cached page either, but that will be difficult since the cache system loads so early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more, there&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-boost/caching-site-content/\">fine manual to read</a>. It explains in detail how to enable the cache and how to use it. Yes, I&#8217;m biased, but I think you should give <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-boost/\">Jetpack Boost</a> a go! Caching helps a lot, but the extra CSS and JavaScript features help render the page quickly once loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 11 Mar 2024 16:51:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Asia 2025 Scheduled For Next February in Manila, Philippines\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=154814\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-asia-2025-scheduled-for-next-february-in-manila-philippines\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1776:\"<p>WordCamp Asia has unveiled its host city for 2025 &#8211; <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/\">Manila</a>, Philippines.

However, due to the pandemic in 2020, it became the first international event to be <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-asia-2020-canceled-over-covid-19-concerns\">canceled</a> and finally became a reality only in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known as the Pearl of the Orient, Manila is the vibrant capital of the Philippines. Every corner promises to delight and charm the visitors, from the historic walled city of Intramuros to the bustling markets and majestic churches of Quiapo. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WC Asia 2023 had a dedicated team of 53 organizers while the 2024 version saw 46 individuals in action.

Notable guests, including WordPress Cofounder <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a> and Executive Director <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, joined the diverse lineup of <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/speakers/\">speakers</a>.

After exploring both concepts, she posed an important question to the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>What would it take for someone to move from a walled garden to a community garden?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source software, symbolized by community gardens, represents freedom from copyright restrictions and usage limitations. Unlike proprietary software (described as walled gardens), the core value lies in long-term empowerment, giving people control and ownership of their digital presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acknowledging the longstanding values held by WordPress and its open source community for two decades, Josepha focused on the importance of caring for foundations that make us strong, managing what distracts us, and nurturing growth by embracing new opportunities. She celebrated the strengths of the WordPress community and how its shared ethos furthers a thriving ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/03/wcasia-slide.png?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1\" alt=\"Slide from Josepha Haden Chomphosy\'s presentation showing colorful flowers on a blue background and the quote, \" />\n\n\n\n<p>Quoting artist and activist Audrey Hepburn, Josepha expressed that, much like a community garden, the power of contributions—whether through time, knowledge, or product use— sustains and maintains shared spaces like WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/UK7FnaEeTrU?si=pjg0nkwla-d7mP69&t=32274\">Q&amp;A portion</a> of her presentation, Josepha addressed inquiries about community involvement and contributions.

So, based on that &#8220;usage rate&#8221; number, Hello Elementor is the most-popular theme in the wp.org repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh wait&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1665\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/edward-howell-VlTJdP8ZY1c-unsplash-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Flowers arranged from short to tall so it looks like a chart.\" class=\"wp-image-154775\" />Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@edwardhowellphotography?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Edward Howell</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/pink-flower-on-white-background-VlTJdP8ZY1c?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oceanwp-and-generatepress-crush-hello-elementor-in-user-enthusiasm\">OceanWP and GeneratePress Crush Hello Elementor in User Enthusiasm</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is an arbitrary metric I created called the “enthusiasm gap”.&nbsp; This is the number of 1-star reviews divided by the number of 5-star reviews (lower “enthusiasm gap” is better):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>GeneratePress: 1378 5-star reviews, &lt;1% enthusiasm gap.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>OceanWP: 5412 5-star reviews, &lt;1% enthusiasm gap.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Astra: 5297 5-star reviews, 2% enthusiasm gap.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Storefront: 122 5-star reviews, 11% enthusiasm gap.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hello Elementor: 90 5-star reviews, 14% enthusiasm gap.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>GeneratePress and OceanWP seem to have rabid followings based on this enthusiasm gap metric.&nbsp; Astra also has a great enthusiasm gap at 2%.&nbsp; But Hello Elementor…14% &#8211; that’s…high compared to the competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme reviews are, of course, totally subjective and can be manipulated by marketing pushes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it’s also possible that a high volume of 5-star reviews is <em>actually</em> an indicator of enthusiasm for the theme. For example, OceanWP has 5,412 reviews, whereas Hello Elementor has only 90 reviews.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s that say about those particular themes?&nbsp; Who knows?!&nbsp; It’s not clear why OceanWP has 60x the 5-star reviews of Hello Elementor, but surely something good is happening over at OceanWP, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And maybe Hello Elementor is awesome despite its low enthusiasm gap numbers. It is, after all, dominating the “usage rate” metric, which is the metric WP Data Dashboard endorses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps my “enthusiasm gap” metric is pointless dribble that I made up on the spot as I wrote this article and didn’t run it through a deeper analysis to learn if my assumptions were sound.

Below are some of their opinions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Beaver Builder (specifically using the Beaver Themer plugin) because it is almost just as powerful as creating my own theme (what I used to do before Beaver Themer was released), but with the fast, easy and powerful features of Beaver Builder. I&#8217;m never going back!” &#8211; Barbara S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Impreza.” &#8211; Aaron H.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I also use Beaver Builder/Themer, but not the theme. I’ve always used Genesis and still do. I use Mai Theme as my base, much to the horror of the dev who never intended it to be used with a builder. Sometimes I try to use the block editor on a basic page, but it still feels clumsy and unintuitive to me. I love Mai Theme because of the scalable fonts and spacing and the navigation is very well done.” &#8211; Jodi S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My favorite theme is either &#8220;Hello Elementor&#8221; (the barebones vanilla theme when building a site with Elementor), or just using Bricks.” &#8211; John V.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“+1 for Impreza! Have built 20-30 sites with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$59 one time purchase.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Comes with WP Bakery Page Builder, which is my go to. Love the backend editor.&nbsp; Extremely intuitive.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Theme Options are very integrated with WP Bakery and include drag-n-drop Header/Footer builder, Reusable Blocks, Grid Builder, and Template Builder.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When used with ACF, I never have to touch code because WP Bakery has a Custom Field element that pulls in any ACF field I want.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Comes bundled with Slider Revolution, ACF Pro, to name a few.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Theme Support is incredible!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>My 2.7 cents!” &#8211; Matt C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My favorite theme is Enfold. They have a really nice drag-and-drop system and the theme is super versatile. Good customer support and good performance improvements as browser changes are implemented.” &#8211; Beth B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve been a Divi user since almost the beginning. It also has a drag-and-drop system and a visual builder that allows edits from the front end as well as the dashboard.”—Lisa D.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have been using Astra theme a lot. Got a lifetime license for Astra Premium &amp; Astra Pro which has been so worth it for fast customization.” &#8211; Donna</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have been using Astra a lot for the past three years or so. It has great benefits and a few unfortunate flaws, but on the whole it is a win for us. Astra is a more traditional theme than Genesis, easier to build child themes with, but it has a huge depth of hooks, making it just as flexible and customizable for our clients as we found with Genesis years ago.” &#8211; Eric C.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“GeneratePress is a powerful lightweight framework.” &#8211; David S.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"about-the-data\">About the Data</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I used <a href=\"https://www.wp-data-dashboard.com/themes\">WP Data Dashboard</a> as my data source.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Data Dashboard pulls raw data from the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API#Popular_theme_tags\">WP.org API</a> and then give each theme a “usage rate”, to determine whether or not people actually like the theme enough to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;[See <a href=\"https://github.com/luehrsenheinrich/wp-data-dashboard/blob/96784c60d91420f6617d214a84e21834f0d0218c/src/Service/WpOrgApiCrawlService.php#L672-L724\">specific calculations</a>.]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“While the data from the&nbsp;data has it’s limitations and should be taken with a grain of salt, the available numbers paint a pretty clear picture of what users actually want to use,&#8221; says WP Data Dashboard founder, Hendrik Luehrsen said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Twenty Fifteen theme has a very high download count but very low “active install” numbers &#8211; It therefore has a very low “usage rate” on WP Data Dashboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, Twenty Twenty-Three theme, being a relatively new default theme, has both a high download count and high “active install” count, giving it a high “usage rate”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A WP core update is a download of a ‘Twenty’ theme,” said a member of the WP Core team.&nbsp; “Even though the theme might not be in use, it’ll get a lot of downloads.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, for the purposes of this article, I ignore all the default &#8220;Twenty&#8221; themes since their download counts are inflated:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two final caveats on the data: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download counts can be inflated by releasing more updates to the theme, marketing efforts, purchased reviews, etc. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>The download counts are correct, but the “active_installs” data point is capped at 1,000,000. So we have no idea if a theme has 1,000,000 or 5,000,000 installs. For example, Astra and Hello Elementor each have <em>at least</em> 1 million active installations.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, this is the best data we’ve got, so let’s have some fun with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-is-your-favorite-wp-theme\">What is your favorite WP theme?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep it light and share what your favorite theme is and why in the comments below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"related-links\">Related Links</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\">Popular Themes on WP.org</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTDS6SHwA6w\">“Speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever.”</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-data-dashboard-tracks-wordpress-org-themes-ecosystem\">WP Data Dashboard Tracks WordPress.org Themes Ecosystem</a> (Oct. 2023)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-post-author-biography\">Toby Cryns is a freelance CTO, WordPress consultant, and teacher at <a href=\"https://themightymo.com/\">The Mighty Mo!

Two of the most prominent features, Synced Pattern Overrides and the Font Library, have been stuck in critical debates until today when Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/07/unblocking-wp6-5-font-library-and-synced-pattern-overrides/\">weighed in with an official response</a> and a path forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Font Library is Ready for Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1708987810984969\">conversation arose</a> in the Make WordPress Slack last week that the Font Library may not be ready for 6.5, there was a feeling of déjà vu. The Font Library <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-4-font-library-feature-punted-to-6-5-release\">had already been punted</a> from the last few major releases as the team works to make sure the feature is fully future-proof. Luckily, the decision for 6.5 is that the Font Library will be shipping in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A handful of related issues were brought up, but the conversation centered mostly around <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/59417\">where fonts would be stored for your WordPress website</a>. The Font Library includes a new directory in wp-content/fonts, at the same level as plugins, themes, and more. Because fonts are uploaded by users and fetched as resources, some contributors felt that they should live inside the wp-content/uploads directory, where other uploads and media are placed, and that their architecture should map <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/59387\">more closely to Attachments</a> in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the one hand, it&#8217;s a bit of a philosophical debate: are fonts just &#8220;uploads&#8221; or are they something more fundamental to how we build websites?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A large motivation behind the font library is to introduce fonts as a first-class object within WordPress—stored, described, and managed in a way that allows us to convey this distinct nature alongside other objects,&#8221; Lead Architect Matias Ventura <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/59417#issuecomment-1972978157\">explained</a> in a recent GitHub issue. &#8220;So this is fundamentally an architectural decision we are making and not exclusively one of convenience, which aims to position fonts as a concept alongside themes, plugins, languages, and media uploads within wp-content.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors, including representatives from hosting companies, were concerned that this would cause downstream effects with filesystem security and some of the more complicated off-loading scenarios where assets like images and fonts are cached and distributed separately. Some hosts may even need to modify their architecture to work with this new directory structure. Fortunately <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-includes/fonts.php?rev=57777#L125\">a filter to change the location of fonts</a> was included and iterated upon so that hosts could override the directory location and have more time to consider their approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is that users can look forward to the Font Library shipping in WordPress 6.5, and future work will be done to audit the result, flesh out more of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54186\">the missing features</a>, and discuss the potential effects of adding this new directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Synced Pattern Overrides Gets Overridden</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously referred to as &#8220;partially synced patterns,&#8221; and tied up with the larger concept of the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-block-bindings-api-brings-dynamic-data-to-blocks\">Block Bindings API</a> in WordPress Core, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53705\">Synced Pattern Overrides</a> are not as easily defined as the Font Library. For site builders, though, the concept has been a bit of a holy grail. So it is with much disappointment, mixed with understanding, that the feature will not be shipping in WordPress 6.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Synced Patterns&#8221; in WordPress (formerly &#8220;reusable blocks&#8221;) allow users to create block patterns in which any changes will show up automatically anywhere the pattern is used across your site. Synced Pattern <em>Overrides</em> introduced the next evolution of this feature, where you could &#8220;lock&#8221; the design of your pattern, but allow users to update some of the content, such as text or images, in each pattern instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Concern was raised over how Synced Patterns were defining their ability to have these &#8220;overrides&#8221;, both in the underlying structure and in how the feature was shown in the user interface. These types of &#8220;overrides&#8221; are considered foundational to many of the future goals of the block editor, so it&#8217;s important to get it right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For later, I’d like to note that the feature is not just about &#8216;making things overridable&#8217; by the user,&#8221; clarified Riad Benguella, Automattic-sponsored contributor and Editor Tech Lead for the current release. &#8220;While it’s the immediate use-case, we should think about this more holistically, it’s about separating content and presentation of patterns. It’s about providing a schema for the pattern.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That separation of content and presentation has been a big issue for extenders trying to build maintainable sites using the Block Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My main issue is that this isn&#8217;t a decision we can reverse lightly,&#8221; noted Fabian Kägy, a contributor sponsored by 10up. He reiterated the importance of getting the feature right in Gutenberg before merging it into WordPress core, emphasizing that &#8220;the Gutenberg plugin is meant to be a playground for a feature to grow / iterate upon before it goes into core.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while the underlying architecture of the Block Bindings API will still ship with WordPress 6.5, one of its first visible implementations, Synced Pattern Overrides, will not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Release Cycle Continues</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these last-mile issues also highlighted the unique challenges we face when some of these large new features for WordPress are built inside the Gutenberg plugin, rather than in a separate feature plugin. The tradeoffs to this approach to feature development was one of the key issues <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenbergs-project-leadership-sits-down-with-new-outreach-team-to-discuss-problems-with-the-site-editor\">discussed in a Hallway Hangout last week</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, contributors are racing to finish work or else document changes on many less prominent issues that were also discovered during the beta releases, including <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/59548#issuecomment-1980983287\">an update to how HTML is parsed in code blocks</a> and issues with changes to make <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/59635\">the block editor more accessible</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When WordPress 6.5&#8217;s first release candidate was launched on Tuesday, the cycle transitioned into a &#8220;string freeze&#8221; so that translators could begin their work. The 6.5 Field Guide, Dev Notes, and Make Core announcements are all being drafted for publication. And all of this work is set to the backdrop of the flagship <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCamp Asia</a> conference going on now in Taipei and featuring much of the project&#8217;s leadership and core team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.5, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6.5/\">scheduled for March 26, 2024</a>, is shaping up to be quite the eventful release, and features like the Font Library, Plugin Dependencies, and the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/interactivity-api-prepares-for-its-official-debut-in-wordpress-6-5\">Interactivity API</a> have many in the community excited for what&#8217;s to come.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 07 Mar 2024 18:22:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Brian Coords\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"Do The Woo Community: What March is Looking Like Here at Do the Woo\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=79212\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://dothewoo.io/on-the-road-wordcamp-asia-cloudfest/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:395:\"<p>With WordCamp Asia and CloudFest, our schedule will be a bit off but just wait for the recordings we will be getting while on the road.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/on-the-road-wordcamp-asia-cloudfest/\">What March is Looking Like Here at Do the Woo</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce and WordPress Builder Podcast</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 07 Mar 2024 03:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: WordPress Developer Docs Shows Off a New Block-Based Redesign\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=154710\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-developer-docs-shows-off-a-new-block-based-redesign\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10385:\"<p>Over the years, WordPress&#8217;s developer documentation, originally the <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/\">Codex</a> but now the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/\">WordPress Code Reference</a>, has served the project well. However, there&#8217;s been a sense in the community that much of the more recent documentation- for example, the JavaScript APIs and packages coming out of Gutenberg- has been inconsistent and harder to read and understand. Developers often find themselves navigating disconnected designs and organization throughout the various docs, guides, and handbooks for topics that might cover anything from the Shortcodes API to WP-CLI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This past December, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2023/12/15/developer-resources-gets-a-refresh/\">WordPress.org&#8217;s entire Developer Resources subdomain relaunched</a> with much more intuitive homepage, cohesive navigation, and a modern design. In developer circles and on social media, the relaunch was met with rave reviews, along with more than a few sighs of relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"1246\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/developer-resources-homepage-grey-2.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshots of the Developer Resources home page after and before the redesign.\" class=\"wp-image-154712\" />After and Before. Source: make.wordpress.org\n\n\n\n<p>Although the redesign appeared almost three months ago, it belongs in the WP Tavern as a modern milestone for the WordPress project. I caught up with Nick Diego, a Developer Advocate sponsored by Automattic, to learn more about the story behind the redesign and what else we can expect from WordPress.org&#8217;s multi-year migration to a new look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Defining a Project Scope</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve seen Nick&#8217;s name recently, it may be from his popular WordPress plugins, such as <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/show-and-hide-content-via-the-block-visibility-wordpress-plugin\">Block Visibility</a> and the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/add-custom-svgs-via-the-icon-block-wordpress-plugin\">Icon Block</a>, or else his work on the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/\">WordPress Developer Blog</a>. The team of contributors running the Developer Blog have been busy educating readers on how to work with many of the new and experimental tools coming out of the Block Editor. But some of them are also deep in the trenches trying to rewrite twenty years of legacy developer resources, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2023/04/04/theme-handbook-overhaul-proposal/\">like Justin Tadlock&#8217;s ongoing work with the Theme Handbook</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the big focuses for my team,&#8221; Nick explained, &#8220;was to try and improve the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/\">Block Editor Handbook</a> and the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/\">Themes Handbook</a>. And so we&#8217;re working on the content of it, and there&#8217;s still tons of work to do there, but one of the things we identified early on was that the structure and the design of the site, it just made things worse.&#8221; (I&#8217;ll spare readers the links to my numerous Twitter and podcast rants on that exact topic.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once they realized this, the team was confronted with a choice. They could simply ignore the issues with the outdated design and continue updating content. They could completely rethink the way that the developer documentation for the project was built and start a massive restructuring. Or they could keep working within the existing architecture but focus on cleaning up the glaring gaps in design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They chose that third approach &#8211; focusing on redesigning what they had, rather than trying to advocate for an entirely new documentation platform. That also freed up more time to continue updating the most important part: the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I would rather spend my time fixing [the content],&#8221; Nick explained. &#8220;Because then if we ever get to a point where we want to re-architect the whole thing, then it&#8217;s an architectural problem and not an &#8220;oh, and all our content&#8217;s all wrong problem&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team began work on updating the content and design in tandem, and Nick was able to draw on his experience helping out with the recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-relaunches-showcase-powered-by-blocks\">redesign of the Showcase</a> on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Documentation by Contribution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One important caveat for WordPress documentation is that it is also open to contribution, just like WordPress core. That means that the structure in which documentation is written, discussed, and hosted needs to be available to any contributor who might be able to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the documentation, like the Theme Handbook, is actually post content inside of a WordPress installation. Nick explained that &#8220;it&#8217;s really hard to contribute to, because you can&#8217;t go write a pull request somewhere. You have to open an issue that says, &#8216;Hey, there&#8217;s a spelling error here&#8217; or &#8216;Hey, this paragraph should be changed&#8217; and then some docs contributor that has permission used to go in and make it. It is wildly challenging.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the team wants content to be collaborative, it ultimately needs to have some connection to GitHub, where collaboration tends to happen. The benefit to this approach is that developer documentation can be an onramp to becoming a WordPress contributor. Once you&#8217;ve made a small pull request fixing a spelling error, it becomes a little easier to consider making a PR with an actual code change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So we have some pieces of the site [in WordPress],&#8221; said Nick. &#8220;We have some pieces that are on GitHub. There&#8217;s other parts that are generated from source code, other pieces that are part of packages. So it&#8217;s a very complicated setup where there&#8217;s content in so many different places, and even with the stuff that&#8217;s in GitHub, it&#8217;s coming from multiple repositories.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, any of the documentation that does live on GitHub has a link to &#8220;Improve it on GitHub&#8221; in the footer, taking you to its source.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Learning From Building Block Themes</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Updating the Developer Documentation site to match the new design language rolling out across WordPress.org meant migrating it from a classic theme to the same underlying <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-parent-2021\">block-based parent theme</a> that all of the newly redesigned WordPress.org sites are using. What some might see as an insurmountable challenge, this team saw as a learning and &#8220;dogfooding&#8221; opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The documentation section is huge,&#8221; said Nick, &#8220;How do you update that to a block theme? So we also looked at it as a project where Meta will learn a lot as the process goes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team could take all of their experiences of migrating a massive website- hundreds of pages of content, some authored inside of WordPress but much of it populated by automated integrations with numerous GitHub repositories- and share the lessons they&#8217;d learn with the core team that was building the Site Editor itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One example that I&#8217;m sure any developer will resonate with was the issue of version control for a block theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Everything in dot org needs version control,&#8221; Nick explained. &#8220;So the Site Editor works, but then you have to sync all the changes back to the template files in the theme. So there are definitely some challenges that the Meta team have had to circumvent because of the unique requirements of dot org. But it&#8217;s been a really interesting case study.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick and his colleagues then used their experience to facilitate <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/59480\">discussions on GitHub</a> with the broader developer community who are also grappling with these exact issues with block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Redesign Continues</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress.org redesign is a multi-year endeavor with a lot of concurrent projects happening. A few that Nick and his colleagues are focused on next include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2024/02/15/project-thread-documentation-redesign/\">redesigning the rest of the WordPress Documentation</a>, a segment of end-user-facing content known as the &#8220;HelpHub&#8221;, along with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forums/\">Forums</a> and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">Patterns Directory</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, their focus is on making sure the community is aware that these redesign projects are all public to review and engage with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick added that &#8220;Figma is public, the GitHub&#8217;s public, but is it as public as it could be from a visual perspective within the community? No. And I think that that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re trying to do better. So we&#8217;re trying to improve the process so it is more visible moving forward.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has been more proactively posting updates on the Make WordPress blog as well as in a dedicated Slack channel, <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C04U953K77A\">#website-redesign</a>. The end goal for these redesigns is to increase the quality and access to information, but also to make contribution to the project easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the things that we&#8217;ve actually seen,&#8221; said Nick &#8220;is that once the redesign happened and there was a bit more spotlight on it and people started using it, then the problems with the UI kind of go away and then you start to see problems with the content, which leads to more people fixing the content.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to the design or the content of some of these upcoming projects, consider joining the WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Slack</a> or following along in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">Make WordPress blog</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Mar 2024 19:03:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Brian Coords\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress – February 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17030\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/03/the-month-in-wordpress-february-2024/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10597:\"<p>February saw significant progress towards the upcoming WordPress 6.5 release and final preparations for WordCamp Asia.

</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We also consider some other implications, such as how usable a feature is on mobile, how it looks in an RTL language, and whether we have sufficient color contrast.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravity Forms also tries to help novice users understand when they are making a change that might break accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“One thing Gravity Forms does that&#8217;s particularly valuable is that it warns you if you&#8217;re using a feature that has known accessibility issues,&nbsp; and that&#8217;s a huge time saver for professionals,” says web accessibility consultant, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/\">Joe Dolson</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"is-wcag-aa-compliant-enough-what-about-wcag-aaa-compliance\">Is WCAG AA-Compliant Enough?&nbsp; What about WCAG <em>AAA</em>-Compliance?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravity Forms promises WCAG AA compliance, which is a great place to start for anyone who is looking to make a website more accessible to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“WCAG2.1 AA is the standard required by most accessibility laws,” says Gravity Forms’ Kay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, “WCAG2.1 <em>AAA</em> is very strict, and includes some standards that are not necessarily realistic or necessary for all types of websites,” Kay adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our goal is to make sure that [our forms] comply to WCAG 2.1AA,” says Kay. “This is not only because we want our forms to be accessible, but also because it is required by some countries.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We provide tools that let users build forms that are WCAG-compliant, but it is still ultimately up to the user to make sure they are following all of the guidelines to meet those requirements,” adds Kay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested that statement in the wild, and it’s true: Gravity Forms gives you all the tools to make your front-end form WCAG AA-compliant out-of-the-box and without any configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you simply add name, email, and phone fields to a Gravity Form, it’ll be WCAG AA compliant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, website owners can optionally or unknowingly break compliance &#8211; and often do.&nbsp; For example, deleting the default form labels will break compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to go far on the web to run into a text input field without a proper label.&nbsp; Oftentimes this is done for aesthetic reasons &#8211; e.g. hiding labels to make the form more compact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-about-other-wp-form-plugins\">What About Other WP Form Plugins?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While other form plugins might be able to create accessible forms, they aren’t as simple to configure for WCAG and ADA compliance, according to some accessibility consultants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For free plugins, Contact Form 7 allows you to create very accessible forms,&nbsp; but you have to know what you&#8217;re doing. It&#8217;s a fine tool if you put in the work, but I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it to the average user,” <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/joedolson/\">Dolson</a> says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another web accessibility consultant, <a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/gslacdao/\">Gerson Lacdao</a> noted his appreciation for Gravity Forms’ efforts while adding some constructive criticism of other WP form plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Some [form plugins] have issues in the most basic [web accessibility] things like properly coded field labels,” says Lacdao.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His favorite form plugin today is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ws-form/\">WS Form</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In terms of accessibility, I would probably put [the WS Form plugin] on top,” Lacdao says. “I like how a lot of accessibility options are available [in WS Form], and I don&#8217;t need to add extra CSS or JS hacks just to make it work better.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"some-form-plugins-accessibility-efforts-seem-reactive-rather-than-proactive\">Some Form Plugins’ Accessibility Efforts Seem Reactive Rather Than Proactive</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lacdao mentioned one example of a popular WP form plugin that is behind on the web accessibility front (I was unable to reach the plugin’s developer for comment and therefore decided to not name the plugin here).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“[That plugin’s accessibility] efforts are mostly reactive and for now only based on tickets or feedback from some users,” says Lacdao. “It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m a bit frustrated about because I feel like it&#8217;s part of their obligation to users to proactively make their product accessible.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to making a clear proactive effort on the web accessibility front, the Gravity Forms team is always on the lookout for new issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravity Forms’ Kay explains, “We usually investigate [accessibility tickets] as soon as they are reported, and we can usually get [them] fixed within one or two minor releases.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-about-accessibility-on-the-admin-end-of-wp-form-plugins\">What About Accessibility on the Admin End of WP Form Plugins?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s tough to talk about web accessibility in the admin side of any plugin without talking about accessibility in the admin of WordPress more generally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on my tests using the WAVE tool, neither WordPress core nor <em>any</em> plugin or theme I tested fared well on web accessibility within the admin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, admin-side accessibility improvements are definitely on Gravity Forms’ agenda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;“[A senior accessibility consultant] has done a complete audit of our plugin in the dashboard, so we know what we need to do to make Gravity Forms accessible in the admin,” Kay said. “We are working on making the admin accessible, and in Gravity Forms 2.9 there will be some improvements.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"notes\">Notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wave.webaim.org/extension/\">WAVE</a> is the testing tool promoted by WebAIM and also used by many web accessibility consultants as a data point for figuring out how a webpage is doing on the accessibility front.&nbsp; It’s not a perfect tool, but it is a great place to start.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I reached out to WP Forms, Ninja Forms, and Forminator Pro in addition to Gravity Forms for inclusion in this article.

The community noted their recent tailwind expansion too. According to its description in <a href=\"https://appsumo.com/products/cwicly-builder/\">AppSumo</a>, “Cwicly is the only builder that interacts directly with the whole Gutenberg ecosystem and adds specialized blocks that are complementary and fully compatible with Gutenberg.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://cwicly.com/\">blog post</a> and email to users, Louis attributed the abrupt decision to&nbsp; “the relentless onslaught of destructive posts and comments by certain WordPress influencers”. He said, “Personal attacks on both myself and team members have been made and openly tolerated throughout. The negativity and hostility directed towards Cwicly, especially in comparison to other page builders, have taken a significant toll on our morale and motivation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“The passion and dedication that we have had from the start has been gradually diluted, enthusiasm has given way to dread. Working in such a negative climate has taken a significant toll on the team, making it nearly impossible to continue. Each day has become a struggle.”&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Louis assured users that Cwicly services will continue until the end of 2024, with reimbursements for all orders made after January 1, 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The statement was later retracted from the website, stating the discontinuation of the plugin development and ensuring user support during the transition period. However, the original statement is still available in <a href=\"https://discourse.cwicly.com/t/discontinuation-of-cwicly-development/5522\">Discourse</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reaction of the Community&nbsp;</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community reacted with surprise and shock, especially considering that new features had been released just days before. “This is the biggest shock I’ve had in the recent past! Had to check if the date was 1st April. I hope Cwicly undo their decision” tweeted WordPress developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/srikat/status/1764385731563454614\">Sridhar Katakam</a> while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress/status/1764340304721727602\">Jamie Marsland</a>, founder of Pootlepress, called the statement released “a very sad statement”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several people searched for scathing reviews and tweeted about not finding any devastating reviews or comments against Cwicly while others mentioned seeing negative comments in Facebook groups.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/arniepalmer/status/1764410609867559144\">Andrew Palmer</a>, co-founder of Bertha.AI revealed he has “seen a few comments on YT education videos for Cwicly where commenters say it’s trash.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/dynamicwordpress/permalink/1456468901975256/\">Sujay Pawar</a>, CEO of Brainstorm Force, posted on Facebook “If you&#8217;re active in Facebook groups, you know how toxic some communities can be with trolls. I&#8217;ve had to take breaks from Facebook for my own mental health. I think Cwicly&#8217;s decision to stop must have been about more than just mean comments from some influencers. It&#8217;s probably about all the challenges of running a WordPress products business, especially the financial aspects, in demotivating communities where people are quick to criticize without realizing there&#8217;s a human being on the other side.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/dynamicwordpress/permalink/1455267252095421/\">David McCan</a>, who had published “<a href=\"https://www.webtng.com/the-cwicly-conundrum/\">The Cwicly Conundrum: Two Years On Is It Ready to Use Yet</a>?” posted “I suspect that my article The Cwicly Conundrum may have contributed to their loss of morale.&nbsp; While as far as I know what I wrote was accurate, I realize that I was expressing my frustrations about feeling it wasn’t ready yet.&nbsp; I’m sorry if this contributed to their loss of morale, and it is a reminder that as a user and reviewer it is important to remember the people behind the product.” He continued “Cwicly is cutting edge and made a good contribution to the WordPress ecosystem.&nbsp; I hope the Cwicly team is able to continue with it, but if they don’t feel they can then I encourage them to keep it going long enough to look for someone who would want to purchase it, so they get some return and the product can live on.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpmodder/status/1764370654332068326\">Adam W. Warner</a>, GoDaddyPro Director Field Marketing, shared, “I’ve never used it, but everything mention I’ve seen of it was positive. Raving fans in fact. Obviously there’s been negative feedback somewhere though. However, as a business owner, it pays to have a thick skin for the naysayers. Easy to say, harder to do.” Justin Ferriman also agreed,&nbsp; “Criticism and entrepreneurship go hand-in-hand (especially in the case of products). Probably just wasn&#8217;t for the founder, and that&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s stressful.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Tampa Bay organizer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schutzsmith/status/1764363078689264076\">Daniel AwesomeSmith</a> hoped “they’re not blaming community when it’s just business acumen and product fit to blame the most.” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thekevingeary/status/1764363817901834463\">Kevin Geary</a>, WordPress entrepreneur, clarified that he “spent the last 3-5 months telling everyone that Cwicly is the 2nd best page builder for WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-founder of Newsletter Glue, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lesley_pizza/status/1764477373263819040\">Lesley Sim</a> tweeted, “I don&#8217;t think shutting down is the right answer, I think levelling up as a business owner is. But, you can&#8217;t really teach that. They just have to decide to do it.” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexjvasquez/status/1764426557412737220\">Alex Vasquez</a> of DigiSavvy “wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the owner/dev reverses course on their decision to shutter @cwicly. I find it beyond wild to just abandon your customers like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Consider rebranding Cwicly instead of shutting it down &#8211; a fresh start can help overcome negativity and attract a more positive audience.” recommended entrepreneur <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mahdiali_/status/1764641586330370386\">MahdiAli Khanusiya</a>. “Some of the big guys like @automattic, @LiquidWeb, @syedbalkhi should check out @cwicly. Could be an acquisition / buy out. There&#8217;s a lot of great features there that could end up in core, or at least shouldn&#8217;t be thrown out.” proposed WPAI founder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameswlepage/status/1764532987507421294\">James LePage</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have reached out to Louis and am still waiting to hear back from him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Louis-Alexander Désiré has issued an update on <a href=\"https://discourse.cwicly.com/t/the-future-of-cwicly/5536\">Cwicly&#8217;s Discourse site</a> about their future plans. They have reimbursed the new subscribers and will provide support to all users till 2024. From 2025 onwards, they will offer maintenance plans at discounted rates for those who wish to continue to benefit from Cwicly updates but no new features will be introduced. More details will be shared later. Lifetime holders can continue to enjoy maintenance benefits and access the Cwicly plugin at no extra cost.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 05 Mar 2024 18:23:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.5 Release Candidate 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17008\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/03/wordpress-6-5-release-candidate-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10939:\"<p>The first release candidate (RC1) for WordPress 6.5 is ready for download and testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>.<strong> Please do not install, run, or test this version of WordPress on production or mission-critical websites.</strong> Instead, it’s recommended that you evaluate RC1 on a test server and site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reaching this phase of the release cycle is an important milestone.

Hopefully progress.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg may have surprised a few people when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e92_Wo-bIng\">he recently stated</a> that the Gutenberg project still has <em>years</em> of development to go, but I doubt that anyone using it would disagree. The tentpole feature of Gutenberg&#8217;s Phase Two, the &#8220;Site Editor,&#8221; has been in core (and enabled by default for new installations) for the last two years, but the adoption of block-based themes has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hluehrsen/status/1759881773461168600\">felt underwhelming at best</a>, especially compared to the <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-elementor\">market share of page-building tools like Elementor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has their opinions of the block editor, one need only browse the comments section of this very site to find them. The reality however is that WordPress is a vast and complicated project. While it&#8217;s certainly subject to the decisions of its &#8220;Benevolent Dictator&#8221;, it is also subject to the very real constraints of large-scale, distributed, open-source software development. Not to mention the work is entirely based on contributions, many of which are sponsored by large organizations with their own goals for the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the center of all of this are the individual WordPress end users who can feel like they have no agency in the project, no ability to communicate their experiences or give feedback. And there may be no piece of software in more critical need of user feedback than the WordPress Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Outreach Experiment<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/feed#76dd9696-f1d1-4d83-825d-d5e6dbe973b7\" id=\"76dd9696-f1d1-4d83-825d-d5e6dbe973b7-link\">1</a></sup> </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The FSE Outreach Experiment <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/help-steer-the-future-of-wordpress-via-the-fse-outreach-program\">was launched three years ago</a> as a way to bridge that gap between users experiencing the Site Editor and the core contributors building it. Last week, the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-experimental-loses-two-words-gains-new-life\">program announced a simplified name and scope</a>: Outreach. As part of this new simplified scope, any core contributor can now tag Outreach directly in GitHub as they develop new features when they want early feedback from the broader community. The goal is getting more two-way communication happening, and keeping the feedback where it can be most effective: the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Make WordPress Slack</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordPress/gutenberg\">Gutenberg</a> code repository on GitHub.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media may feel like the easiest place to voice an opinion (something I am certainly guilty of), but it doesn&#8217;t always manifest into meaningful change. &#8220;Most of our issues are around just discoverability,&#8221; Developer Advocate and Outreach member Justin Tadlock <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/23/recap-hallway-hangout-whats-next-for-the-outreach-program/\">pointed out recently</a>. &#8220;Just getting people to come and take all their reactions and thoughts from social media and bring it in and have some constructive conversations in an official channel.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic Product Wrangler Anne McCarthy has served as the Editor Triage Lead for the last handful of WordPress Core releases and led the original FSE Outreach Experiment. They recently collected some of this feedback on the Site Editor in the form of a widely circulated blog post, &#8220;<a href=\"https://nomad.blog/2024/02/16/overlapping-problems/\">Overlapping problems</a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s a breakdown of some of the most common user experience complaints, but nearly every piece of feedback links to a specific issue or pull request where work is being done to improve it. If you haven&#8217;t already, I recommend pausing now to read it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the problems are &#8220;overlapping&#8221;, some feel that they speak to an underlying problem with the Site Editor itself and the Gutenberg development process more broadly. Many armchair theories were thrown out, including some from yours truly, at last week&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/27/summary-of-hallway-hangout-on-overlapping-problems-in-the-site-editor/\">Hallway Hangout</a>, hosted by the Anne McCarthy, and attended by a wide array of other leaders, including Gutenberg&#8217;s Lead Architect, Matias Ventura and Product Manager, Rich Tabor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is the Core Team listening?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback loops in a community this large and diverse are (un)surprisingly hard to get right. One clear piece of feedback, though, seems to be a general feeling that while the Site Editor&#8217;s power and feature-set continue to grow, the actual user experience needs more polish. Yet when concerns about this user experience are raised, the general response is that it’s the users who just need more education and training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a sentiment that I kept seeing,&#8221; Mike McAlister of <a href=\"https://olliewp.com/\">Ollie</a> explained on the call, &#8220;that &#8216;they&#8217;re not listening to us&#8217;. And whether that&#8217;s perception or their experience or whatever, I think that is very important for us to carry that and to kind of acknowledge it.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the disconnect between the different sides of our large community is related to that imbalance of incentives amongst contributors. Unless you are employed by a hosting company or a product team like WooCommerce or Yoast, it may feel discouraging to push a feature forward or feel like no one is advocating for your use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is meant to democratize the ability to put content on the internet. So there&#8217;s an expectation that its interface should feel, well, easier or at least more intuitive. Nick Diego, Developer Advocate from Automattic, shared an experience of watching his non-technical parents navigate the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the biggest issues I see in the Site Editor,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;is around how changes that you make are preserved to prevent people from making mistakes. And this seems like such a small little thing, but I watched [my dad] delete a template that had been customized and there was no way to get it back easily. I watched him click on &#8216;Clear Customizations&#8217; and everything was gone. And he was like, wait, what, what&#8217;s happening?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick was showcasing a great practical example of the types of gaps in the user experience that eventually erode their trust in the platform’s ability to safely manage content. He also pointed out that there are tried and true conventions for many of these interactions. &#8220;In old WordPress, when you trash the page, it goes into the trash and then you can delete it permanently, right? It goes into your trash. Oh, I made a mistake? I can bring that back. It&#8217;s a very logical flow. It&#8217;s very similar to other applications.&#8221; But the Site Editor often veers into uncharted territory when it comes to user interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New tools and new paradigms aren&#8217;t just hard for the non-technical users. They can present new challenges for the developers who are trying to launch new WordPress sites. Time that developers previously spent building websites is now often spent exploring new potential workflows, and we can&#8217;t rely on our previous two decades of established best practices when scoping new projects. &#8220;I think part of this too,&#8221; said Anne McCarthy, &#8220;is also how to use these tools and changing process because everything I&#8217;ve heard is it&#8217;s not only a technical change and adjusting to new technology, but it&#8217;s changing process.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This idea of slowing down and refining the basic user experience was reiterated by Brian Gardner, Developer Advocate at WP Engine, who advocated &#8220;a call to rally around making what we have already better and consistent and easy to identify and work and document and educate.&#8221; WP Engine in particular has leaned into the developer/freelancer side of the community, with a team of educators and content creators, and products like <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\">Advanced Custom Fields</a> and <a href=\"https://localwp.com/\">LocalWP</a>, all focused on a segment of the market they call &#8220;<a href=\"https://wpengine.com/builders/\">Builders</a>&#8221; and what the Core Team often refers to as &#8220;extenders&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Extenders<sup class=\"fn\"><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/feed#0d40de72-2166-4c3e-a55b-82e973a8f179\" id=\"0d40de72-2166-4c3e-a55b-82e973a8f179-link\">2</a></sup></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Extenders, builders, developers, freelancers, agencies. There&#8217;s plenty of names for this side of the community, but the one thing they have in common is that they build a lot of websites, often for other, less-technical people. There&#8217;s widespread sentiment in this group that the Gutenberg&nbsp; project is not prioritizing their needs, driving them to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor</a> or page builders like Elementor, Divi, and Bricks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fabian Kägy is a member of the Outreach program and a sponsored contributor from the agency <a href=\"https://10up.com/\">10up</a>. He&#8217;s focused on fostering more conversation between the extender community and core development, so I spoke to him about this disconnect in priorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are so many different users that have all different calls&#8221;, he told me. &#8220;And kind of the reason why I am trying to participate is to share that one side of the story and be an advocate for that particular work. And I am very much hoping that I can actually get more similar folks from other agencies to also chime in and be a part of a conversation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Fabian, I come from the agency world, where we are constantly stuck trying to balance the desire to adopt the newest technologies for our clients with the need for assurance that those new features are actually ready to be used in production. That presents a tough problem to solve. The core team needs more people using and testing these features, to help refine them. But from the outside perspective, we&#8217;re hesitant to use anything that may not be production-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At the time a feature lands in WordPress Core,&#8221; Fabian explained, &#8220;there could be four or five months since the developer had originally worked on the feature. Since they last even thought about the feature, they&#8217;ve moved on and shipped three other features. And so that feedback cycle from the agency space is incredibly slow because by the time we adopt it, that is not top of mind anymore.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gap between the development of a new feature and its adoption by the wider community is the main problem the Outreach program is hoping to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That is why I am hoping that this kind of outreach,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;getting more pings, getting asked the question of &#8216;Hey, is this the right thing?&#8217; Being asked to provide feedback earlier in kind of the development cycle should help us be able to deliver that feedback earlier in the cycle so that we don&#8217;t end up in the situation where a year after the feature has been developed, we all of a sudden say, &#8220;Hey, but this didn&#8217;t account for these issues that we are running into.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If airing your Gutenberg grievances on social media is unhelpful, raising them six months after a feature was originally developed and tested might even be less so. But with the huge array of features being worked on (there are over 1,000 open pull requests just in the Gutenberg repository), some on a timescale of years, WordPress needs the Outreach program&#8217;s ability to do some human curation, often in the form of &#8220;Hallway Hangouts&#8221; where new features are showcased and discussed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We are the world, we are the contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch any meeting of the Outreach program, and you&#8217;ll quickly realize that everyone, including a number of Automattic-sponsored contributors, often appear just as &#8220;in the dark&#8221; as we do. They have many of the same struggles we have. The difference is, they are trying to build a space where we can all connect the dots together. It was a great reminder that we&#8217;re all contributors here. WordPress isn&#8217;t <em>some people over there building a thing</em>, it&#8217;s just <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2023/10/02/we-are-they-fostering-belonging-as-a-wordpress-contributor/\">a whole lot of us</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those people is Matias Ventura, considered by many the de facto lead of the Gutenberg project. Matias joined this most recent Hallway Hangout, listening to feedback and sharing his initial impressions. After hearing from a number of voices asking about some of the features in Gutenberg that still need polish, he was quick to clarify that there is still work to be done and conversations that need to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think part of that,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;is also how we communicate, how we do the marketing, both internally to know the roadmap where we&#8217;re heading, but also if you have this specific use case, what are the things that you should keep in mind? Because there&#8217;s a lot of things to absorb and configure them properly and so forth.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many, this response hints at one of the core issues we face with the Site Editor: understanding when a problem is a lack of education or an actual lack in functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matias clarified his thoughts, &#8220;I think that depending on the use cases, I would say yeah, the Site Editor is absolutely ready for some of those. For some others, I think like, yeah, you might not have all the right tools, or you might need to reach out to other plugins in the ecosystem to fill in the gaps.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over a year ago, the WordPress project <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-3-development-kicks-off-to-conclude-gutenberg-phase-2\">announced the transition</a> from Phase 2 (Customization) to Phase 3 (Collaboration), sparking concern that the Site Editor was going to be left not fully realized. What this Hallway Hangout made clear was that the Core Team is still very dedicated to working on these overlapping issues with the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re going to need all the help they can get, and the Outreach contributors certainly has their work cut out for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the easiest way to get involved,&#8221; Fabian told me, &#8220;is to raise your hand and say, &#8216;Hey, I want to become a part of this team on GitHub&#8217; so that you then receive those notifications in your inbox about features that are looking for more feedback. And then from there you can, at your own leisure, at whatever amount of time you have to dedicate it to open source, take a look at just the titles of those pull requests or read through the quick description if you have at that time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re in the weeds of building WordPress websites and implementing new Block and Site Editor features, it can be hard to find the time to give feedback. I certainly have the tendency to go straight to social media when I’m struggling with a lack of functionality or an irritating choice in the user interface. That said, I’m invested in the future of WordPress as a platform, so I’m joining the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C015GUFFC00\">#outreach</a> channel in Slack and trying to provide feedback whenever I can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we may not immediately resolve these overlapping problems in the overall experience, the fact that there are core contributors willing to talk openly about the Site Editor’s shortcomings is a sign of progress towards a goal I think we can all agree on: the continued success of the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Update: This article was modified Tuesday, March 5 to better clarify the roles of various contributors and the Outreach program more broadly.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-neutral-500-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-neutral-500-background-color has-background is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-footnotes\"><li id=\"76dd9696-f1d1-4d83-825d-d5e6dbe973b7\">Sounds like a great band name <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/feed#76dd9696-f1d1-4d83-825d-d5e6dbe973b7-link\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />︎</a></li><li id=\"0d40de72-2166-4c3e-a55b-82e973a8f179\">Also sounds like a great band name <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/feed#0d40de72-2166-4c3e-a55b-82e973a8f179-link\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/21a9.png\" alt=\"↩\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />︎</a></li></ol>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 04 Mar 2024 21:51:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Brian Coords\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WordPress.org blog: WordCamp Asia 2024: Q&amp;A with Matt Mullenweg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17015\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/03/wordcamp-asia-2024-qa-with-matt-mullenweg/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2412:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"299\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/03/wcasia-logo.png?resize=1024%2C299&ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Asia 2024\" class=\"wp-image-17016\" />\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia 2024 is just a few days away—starting on March 7 in Taipei, Taiwan.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:29] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> At the end of this week, WordCamp Asia is happening. It&#8217;s one of our largest events dedicated to WordPress, and it will cover a wide range of topics. From advanced concepts like running thriving businesses to more beginner things like building your first theme, there is bound to be something for you at this event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who have the opportunity to attend in person, you might also be going to your first-ever Contributor Day. Now, as much as I want there to be something for everyone there, I recognize that it&#8217;s a little more frenetic than your average WordPress event. It&#8217;s not any less welcoming than the event that has like a schedule and, tracks, and rooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:19] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But in my experience of any group of open source contributors, they get really excited when they are tackling problems together. And that&#8217;s most of what happens at a Contributor Day. It can make it a little difficult to see how you can join in. But never fear; the crew at the WordPress Briefing has you covered. We&#8217;ve got a couple of ways you can contribute immediately, no code required, and a handful of good next steps when you&#8217;re feeling comfortable and ready to level up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For total beginners, so you&#8217;ve got a WordPress site, or you know, you&#8217;re about to launch one. And you&#8217;re here to learn and meet people and hopefully find someone who answers the questions you feel too shy to mention in public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So these two ways of contribution are for you. First, you can contribute photos. WordPress has a photo directory for openly licensed photos, which are included in Openverse searches. Users can submit photographs to be used by folks all over the world. There are some basic guidelines, such as no faces or identifying characteristics. It can&#8217;t be overly edited or processed, but even photos taken on a smartphone are accepted. Because we understand that the best camera is the one you have on you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:30] <strong>Josepha</strong>: You can also contribute translations. If you speak a language other than English, you can visit <code>translate.WordPress.org</code> and help translate not only the WordPress software but also plugins, themes, and other parts of the WordPress project into your native language. Since more than half of all WordPress installations are in non-English languages, adding or improving translations is really impactful. We are actually at WordCamp Asia trialing a new self-serve translation day process. So that&#8217;s a great place to have a double impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So those are your two completely code-free ways that you can contribute, completely beginner friendly ways to contribute at Contributor Day coming up later this week. And then for your next steps, so say that you&#8217;ve had your site for a while, you are an absolute expert in the admin, you&#8217;ve had to answer a few tough questions for yourself, you&#8217;ve watched a lot of tutorials, and so now you&#8217;re thinking of ways you can share that knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Here are a few ways that you can exercise your new knowledge and really solidify it in your brain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can contribute help. Supporting other WordPress users is a great way to give back to WordPress. This can involve answering questions, providing guidance, or even providing the right resources to users. You can check out the WordPress support forums for more information, and they actually have a dedicated support team as well that works toward making sure that WordPress users have answers to the questions they are asking. You can head over to WordPress.org/support/forums and just pick an appropriate area for you, something that you are currently an expert in, and start answering questions. Start contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Second thing you can do is you can contribute patterns. So WordPress has a dedicated Patterns directory, which stores a list of Block patterns. So custom designs that were created using blocks in Gutenberg that then can be used across any WordPress site, anyone&#8217;s WordPress site. You can submit those patterns, any pattern that you built, to the directory, and then they can be used by people all around the world. Basically, like anything with WordPress, if you put it in there, it can be used by anyone all around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing is that you can contribute events. This is one of my favorite ways to contribute. Organizing in person events to an extent has no code requirement to it, but also it does kind of require that you have a good understanding of your local community and have a willingness to get out there and build your network.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is where it is today thanks to its excellent community and all the lovely in-person events that happen all over the world. They bring our community together, and anyone can contribute by helping to organize just a small gathering or support an in-person event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The fourth way that you can level up your contributions is to contribute by breaking things. I know that sounds weird, but testing the software to see where it breaks is actually a really valuable contribution. It&#8217;s as easy as downloading the WordPress beta tester plugin and the test reports plugin to a WordPress installation, Preferably a testing one, not one that&#8217;s currently publicly in use. But you can test out the newest version of WordPress before the release and provide useful feedback to the development team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the fifth way that you can level up your contribution is to contribute learning. Not that you are learning as a contribution, but what one person can learn through a tutorial or documentation, another person has to learn through discussion and hands-on learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This team, the folks over at <code>learn.WordPress.org</code>, they are the official team and official learning platform and resource for WordPress. They host video tutorials. Yes, but also host live online workshops, courses and even provide lesson plans on different topics related to WordPress. So if you are an educator or otherwise really like to help spread knowledge around, pass around the knowledge that has been hard-earned by you, this is an excellent opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And of course, if you are brave and afraid of nothing, then you can just go to Contributor Day and move from table to table until something sounds interesting to you. You don&#8217;t have to have a plan. Your whole plan can absolutely be to wander until you are found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:45] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now to our small list of big things. It&#8217;s actually a very small list today. I&#8217;ve got two things on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:00] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The first is that a couple of weeks back, we published the results from the 2023 annual survey. So, each year, we collect some high-level data about trends and themes across this vast ecosystem of users and site builders, people who extend WordPress core, and contributors who build WordPress core to help inform decision-making and provide valuable feedback on the project status. I looked at the results from our last survey. We had a bit of an increase in the respondents, not as much as we would have liked, but still a little bit greater number than we had in the past couple of years. And I have a lot of questions myself about what we are doing compared to what we are being asked to do and so go take a look at the blog post that has some highlights from it. It&#8217;s got a couple of contextual pieces of information in there as well, and come with your questions to WordCamps around the world or ask them in community meetings as you find them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the second thing is actually that we have kind of a pilot program going on. There&#8217;s a proposal out right now about GatherPress. It&#8217;s a group of community leaders that have built a tool, a community plugin, to help gather WordPress events a bit better and a bit more &#8220;open source-ely&#8221;. It&#8217;s open currently to anyone who is running a WordPress meetup group that is interested in learning more about how a WordPress-first and open source first community gathering tool might look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I&#8217;ll have a link to the proposal in the show notes that&#8217;ll give you more detailed information and give you an opportunity to figure out how you can join that pilot and help us figure out whether it will work or not ultimately for WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.

Next Gen events are a breath of fresh air for those of us who need something more than the classic WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is available in video, audio, and transcribed text.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Audio version:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transcription:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:00:00]</span> Welcome to the fifth and final episode in my series on the WordPress Photos events that happened in early February. In this episode, we&#8217;re going to rewind just a little bit and look at the project itself. Then we&#8217;re going to cover some really cool information about the event. And then lastly, we&#8217;re going to talk about next gen events in general and some cool things that are coming in the future and some really, some things that I&#8217;m really, really excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s get started. We&#8217;re looking here at the photos page for the project itself. There are currently <span>[00:01:00]</span> 15, 306 photos on this page or on this site. I&#8217;m going to zoom in a little bit so you can see some of these better. Most are taken with cell phones. , some are taken with high-end cameras. There are approximately 30 moderators that, watch over the project and make sure that quality pictures are getting in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a moderator, I can tell you that I&#8217;ve been very, very pleased that, an extraordinarily low number of people have been or attempted to be naughty. Um, photos that are rejected are almost always because the submitter missed a face or a license plate, or. Or maybe didn&#8217;t read the rules precisely, but, I can only think of two or three photos where obviously somebody was trying to game the system and out of 15, 000, that&#8217;s really impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really <span>[00:02:00]</span> happy with that. Uh, something very important to note about these photos is that they are all under creative common zero, which you can see right here,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>creative common zero means no rights reserved. There are no rights reserved. You can do anything with the photo. Anyone can do anything with it. They can remix it. They can sell it. They can, they can use it for something you don&#8217;t agree with. So there&#8217;s good and there&#8217;s bad with it, but it provides an enormous amount of freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s what we wanted. We wanted to be able to provide images that you can put on your website without question, without having to wonder, Oh, is somebody going to come after me someday? So creative comm zero provides a lot of freedom, on this page. If you click. You can see the submitter. There&#8217;s an option to download in multiple <span>[00:03:00]</span> sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s the photo itself. Alternate text. There are tags and categories and colors. Some information about the camera. Information about the image itself. And then you&#8217;re not required to provide attribution. That&#8217;s part of the CC zero thing, but if you want you can and I recommend it it it&#8217;s it&#8217;s polite Uh, and when people find their own image out on the internet It&#8217;s kind of exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty cool. So you can get it in rich text, HTML, or plain text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what about this event that happened? Bigul, who took this picture right here, his community did several photo walks over a couple of months and they were very successful. They got lots of pictures. People had a really good time. And somebody said, Hey, what if we, it is a global event. And so they started <span>[00:04:00]</span> in trying to make it a global event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they talked to the community team and made it a next gen event, which means they got support from the foundation and things like that. And they set up a website, which you can see right here. And a cool thing that happened during the event is that these cards were updated as photos were submitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure Marcus Burnett had something to do with this because it looks like his work, but for observers, you could come here and watch this page change moment by moment, literally, I mean, it was one week and they got, 1, 500 photos or something. So that&#8217;s a lot of photos per day. And then, I wanted to show you the winners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one of the unique things about this event is that there was a contest involved. And there&#8217;s <span>[00:05:00]</span> money on the line, which has never happened at a WordPress event before the top five photographs got a hundred dollars each. And I have to say,  I was a judge, so I should agree with what was selected, but, the number one photo was this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was my number one, amongst, there were several judges, but I picked this one as my number one. Guess those kids look so happy. In a glorious place. Um, it&#8217;s just cool. And one of the rules is no fit, no human faces, but this one makes it because this is an unidentifiable human face. And so to be able to get a human face in and have it still follow the rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is quite a trick. And I&#8217;m impressed. Um, another one that really, really impressed me was this one from Ninesh. We go <span>[00:06:00]</span> look at the detail on that. And then if you click again and again, you&#8217;re looking at individual feathers in this photo, that is incredible to me. So these are the kinds of photos that are making it into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The photo repository. They&#8217;re good. They&#8217;re really, really good. Um, consolation prizes. Um, the next five basically we&#8217;re here and then they gave a hundred dollars to contributors and it didn&#8217;t say how many this person gave. So, I think we want this one. Yes. We make this bigger. Uh, Benita got 82 photos in one week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, Nilo got 79. It&#8217;s around 65. One of the reasons that&#8217;s impressive is that you can only <span>[00:07:00]</span> upload five at a time, and then they have to be moderated before you can upload more. And, it was an incredible high amount of traffic that overwhelmed the moderators. Uh, well here you can see there was 1, 544 approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, there were about 400 not approved, so 2, 000 or so photos. We&#8217;re processed. That&#8217;s incredible. And so it&#8217;s not only impressive that they took 82 photos, but that they were managed to get them through the system that quickly, if you haven&#8217;t watched the Uh, episode with Nilo in it. He tells his secret about how he got to 79.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to know how to get photos through quickly, go watch that episode with Nilo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I want to talk for just a minute about, about the money because it&#8217;s different, it&#8217;s new. Um, and. <span>[00:08:00]</span> It was exciting and it was fun, but it was difficult. It was awkward. The WordCamp system is not built to, to give prize money to attendees. And so, things had to be fiddled with and tweaked and people had weird titles that they wouldn&#8217;t normally have just because they, other people couldn&#8217;t take money, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was, it was weird and it was awkward. So if we were to ever go down this road again, we were probably, we need something to read, we would probably need to build something. And my guess is that&#8217;s not going to happen. Uh, in this particular instance, there was a surplus of cash because they had some sponsors and they were going to spend some money on advertising to get more people to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people attended, they didn&#8217;t need to spend that money. And so there was a surplus and it got distributed. Uh, I don&#8217;t <span>[00:09:00]</span> anticipate that happening in a, a large number of word camps. Uh, since Covid Word camps are much more expensive, they&#8217;re much more difficult to find venues to get good food at a reasonable rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I don&#8217;t expect to see, money available again as at a, as a prize at a, at a event. What do I know? It could happen. Weirder things have happened. This happened, and I wouldn&#8217;t have said this would happen. Uh, so I&#8217;m very happy for the people who won. That&#8217;s, it was a surprise treat, and that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now I want to talk about next generation WordPress events, because, this was one of them. Since COVID, the community teams had a difficult time getting Word camps and meetups to reform to pick back up <span>[00:10:00]</span> and go again, especially in the U. S. And a lot of it had to do with money and a lot of it had to do with the mental Taxation it takes to have an event like this Um, doing a WordCamp is hard work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes a lot of time and energy, a lot of focus, and often things in your life suffer, family time, work time, and people who&#8217;ve done it before are thinking, well, maybe I don&#8217;t need to do that again. And people who haven&#8217;t done it before are thinking, I don&#8217;t know how to do that. I don&#8217;t, is that, is it okay?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can I do that? Um, and then there&#8217;s the financial aspect. Venues are outrageously more expensive than they used to be before COVID. Uh, venues now need insurance and so they have to pay for that. <span>[00:11:00]</span> And they need more staff to, to do things that the insurance requires. So they have to pay for staff and in many places, venues cost double what they did before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we, we just don&#8217;t have the budget for that. Uh, food is similar since COVID there are a lot of new rules about. Food in public places are being served to large groups and that requires insurance, requires new equipment, all that stuff. So the costs of events have gone way up. So one of the things that the community team wanted to come up with was a cheaper way to get it done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, what is, what is the goal of a WordCamp? What is its purpose? Uh, for me, personally, for a lot of years, it&#8217;s been to see my friends. And as much fun as that is, honestly, It&#8217;s not a good investment. Um, I can go see my friends, but much cheaper ways. Um, but if our, if our purpose is to, <span>[00:12:00]</span> to educate people, to further their careers, their knowledge, their wisdom to advance WordPress, then there might be better ways to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m not saying we&#8217;re going to get rid of work camps the way they&#8217;ve always been, we&#8217;ll keep those. But, there are some really, really great new ideas on how to do things in the future. Um, this photo festival costs almost nothing. That&#8217;s one of the reasons they had a few hundred dollars to give away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there was no venue, there was no food, there was no. Lighting people. There were no audio people. Um, and yet it was a huge success. People had a really good time. So I want to show you a few other events. So coming up in Switzerland is a community day, which is just like a, contributor day at a word camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just there, <span>[00:13:00]</span> there aren&#8217;t talks. And it&#8217;s only one day. And so there doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be food. Um, it&#8217;s quick, it&#8217;s focused and it gets things done. Uh, this one&#8217;s exciting. These next three are exciting to me because they&#8217;re all in Africa. The Misaka WordPress and education technology showcase gets, excuse me, gets local educators in Uganda to come together and look at what WordPress can do for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s amazing because we all know that WordPress does well in. lower income communities where they need to be looking at tools and software that they can get and use that work really well without spending a ton of money. Uh, the Kampala Online Payments and Delivery Summit. I just laughed when I saw that one because online payments and delivery in Africa is a completely different animal than anywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, it&#8217;s hard. <span>[00:14:00]</span> Online payments. Just aren&#8217;t there for a lot of Africa. And so having a day focused on, on only that getting it done is brilliant. Um, Rome core days. If you weren&#8217;t here for my talk yesterday with Julia, I was, I told her I have been to contributor days to the core team, half a dozen times, maybe more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re always promised where you&#8217;re going to be a core contributor by the end of the day. And we spent all day long getting half the room set up with half of Docker. And at the end of the day, maybe one person has contributed and it&#8217;s frustrating because I feel like I&#8217;m doing it over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We never make progress, but what if there was a time where it was two days long and it&#8217;s completely focused on just that, and they have enough staff to help everybody rather than one person running around trying <span>[00:15:00]</span> to get everybody set up, that&#8217;s brilliant. Uh, I wanted to do this in my own city a couple of years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it never happened, but it might because now we have precedence. Uh, so this is great. Um, looking at some of the past ones, these are, these are great. The Kolkata career camp. Uh, I was just thinking about this today. Ever been to a college career day where there&#8217;s just a room full of employers? Um, the Kolkata one also had workshops and panel discussions, which I think are brilliant because, young people need to know how to find jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They need the wisdom when they&#8217;re approaching an employer to get a good, a good pay rate, a good vacation system, good compensation system. Um, having it wrapped around work camp. It&#8217;s absolutely brilliant. Um, then there&#8217;s, let&#8217;s see. I had one more down here.<span>[00:16:00]</span> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s community day in Rome. That&#8217;s a different one. Here we go. Japan community building workshop. It&#8217;s all about building community. Um, it says the group will have a six month learning period. That&#8217;s way beyond a WordCamp. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a class, that&#8217;s a college level class. And to be able to learn all of that through WordPress is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So all these different kinds of events are, well these, these all happened already. Then these are coming up. But one of the keys to this is the community team wants new ideas very much. So if you have an idea, Hey, I could do this thing in my town. Um, they want to hear about it. When I was talking to Julia, I suggested in grand <span>[00:17:00]</span> Rapids, my city, we have, kind of a career day, but more about talking about WordPress as a career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we put up flyers and universities and around the city and say things like. Is web development for you? Come find out and we have, a room full of people hiring. We have the, well, just like, just like in Kolkata, we have those room, those talks panels about what does it mean to have a job in web development, in WordPress, maybe just, maybe not only WordPress, maybe we talk about Web dev in general, just working in tech, just all those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If so, they very much want ideas for new kinds of events and you are the one who&#8217;s going to come up with that great idea, somebody has to, it&#8217;s like winning the lottery, you can&#8217;t come up <span>[00:18:00]</span> with a great idea if you don&#8217;t throw it out there and say, Hey, What do you think of my idea? So if you would put stuff in the comments here about some ideas for events, it doesn&#8217;t have to be made by you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to do the event to say, this is an event I would like to go to. That would be great. Um, if you&#8217;re interested in signing up and actually doing an event, you can go to events. wordpress. org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can see all the events that are going on here, WordCamps and the next gen ones. Here are, upcoming events. But then if you want to do one, up in the top right, there&#8217;s Organize an Event. And here&#8217;s all the information about different kinds of events and what it means to organize. Uh, there are meetups, WordCamps, contributor days, virtual events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do action hackathons are great. You <span>[00:19:00]</span> get a room full of WordPress nerds building things for people that need it. And it&#8217;s very exciting and fun. Uh, the looks on people&#8217;s faces when you, when you give them a finished product and one weekend it&#8217;s priceless. Um, so the frequently asked questions, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but this is where you can go to sign up to, to lead any one of these or to become a member of any one of them.

Crazy, right? As luck would have it, four months later, WordCamp Phoenix had announced that their event would be for that same weekend I was to be in town. How lucky was I to have both of my passions collide?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I packed up all my necessary items for the non-WP event earlier in the week, hopped on my flight on the Thursday before camp (WordCamp was scheduled for Friday &amp; Saturday), and headed West.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though I could only attend for a half-day on Friday due to my other commitment, I did notice a few things that were different from past WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reached out to the lead organizer <a href=\"https://phoenix.wordcamp.org/2024/organizers\">Raquel Manriquez</a> and we discussed the overall event compared to years past, struggles, and the future of WordCamps. Below are the questions and answers from the interview. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-neutral-300-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-neutral-300-background-color has-background\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AS: Can you provide a brief overview of this year&#8217;s WordCamp Phoenix 2024, the theme and you coming back as the Lead Organizer? </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM</strong>: There&#8217;s a loaded answer to that question! The theme question is quite interesting. At the beginning of the summer when we started planning we kind of tossed out ideas but we couldn&#8217;t come to a consensus. Some in the team threw out this idea of the “Joy of WordPress.” Like a Bob Ross sort of idea. Full disclosure, I was like, no, I don&#8217;t see it. What does that mean? And the team replied with, “You know, everything will be happy little websites”. I then said, “Happy little websites? Okay, that&#8217;s one thing. What else?” Someone added, “We&#8217;ll all wear Bob Ross wigs.” And I was like, “What? No, it&#8217;s gross!” I just couldn&#8217;t visualize it, so we kind of shelved the idea for a while.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then back in December we brought on Amber Pechin as Content Wrangler. She&#8217;s an incredibly talented writer. She asked about our theme and I mentioned we really didn’t have one but we were kind of toying around with this idea of the Joy of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme crept back in after our WP community starting fighting. And so, we kind of thought, let&#8217;s bring the joy back to what we fell in love with. You know, with the community, with open source, with democratizing publishing. She took that, ran with it, and created this entire like slide deck of what it means to have the Joy of WordPress being WordCamp Phoenix&#8217;s theme. So come full circle, our theme ended up being the Joy of WordPress. Our Wapuu is Bob Rosspuu and it&#8217;s really cute. And we included an art theme around it. I think last summer Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1681676886932332545\">tweeted</a>, that he&#8217;d like to see more art at WordCamps. That inspired us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On me being the lead organizer,… yes I was the lead again. I led in 2018 &amp; 2019 but didn&#8217;t want to lead again necessarily, but we didn&#8217;t have someone else to lead. A struggle of mine is when I&#8217;m misunderstood, misread, or misjudged. Like if someone is judging me for being loud and silly, I don&#8217;t feel offended because I know I&#8217;m that way. But when I’m judged for something I’m not, well, I really struggle. I didn&#8217;t want anyone to think that this is the Raquel show but at the end of the day, I can’t control what others think.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AS: Do you feel that the camp was successful?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM</strong>: Well, that&#8217;s a two-part answer, and it would be yes and no. By my standards, and by WordCamp Phoenix standards in the past, it wasn&#8217;t what we expected. We have typically sold out every WordCamp since 2009. In the early years, 2009 to 2014, we were pretty much the biggest local camp. The only one bigger at the time was WordCamp San Francisco, which became WordCamp US.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Feb 2020 we had a 500-person event and then the pandemic hit. When we brought it back in March 2023 we sold 400 tickets and things felt good. The vibe of the event had great energy. But starting with planning this iteration in 2024, almost from the get-go it was hit with so much shit happening against us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamps are changing with the future of WordCamps reiteration. So there’s that. That was a hard pill for us to swallow because we’ve always been more of a SuperCamp. Even in 2009, we had a huge event. We had huge sponsors like Uber and Cox Internet. We had a <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2009/11/13/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-roundtable-phx09/\">panel with Matt Mullenweg and Josh Strebel</a>, etc&#8230; so small events are not our jam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our 2023 March event gave us good reason to think that this is our community. This is how we show up. So proceeded to have the same #wcphx style event. We submitted our budget. It was denied. Basically due to it being too costly, they wanted us to get a venue that was sub $10k.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I sort of get it, but then again, we have a proven track record that we raise enough money. Even in 2023, we raised almost 30k and that&#8217;s a lot compared to a typical WordCamp. So, we were just put into a really hard place. Which is really what it comes down to. That happened early on and we were left scrambling to find a new venue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found a new venue at Phoenix College but it just wasn&#8217;t the same, as we&#8217;re used to being in actual event spaces. We&#8217;ve never been in a school/college, though I have been to many WordCamps held on campuses, and it was always a blast. So we weren&#8217;t opposed to it and figured it would be fine. But what became clear is that to create that true camp a good chunk of it would be outside. For me, sponsors are the most important aspects of a camp because camps need a lot of money and these sponsors come in knowing that there&#8217;s not going to be an ROI on their monetary investment. It&#8217;s going to be a different ROI, right? And now our Hallway Track/epicenter of WordCamp Phoenix would take place outside which is risky.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were delayed in announcing BY OUR VENUE! And we had a third of our speakers drop. The team got emotional. There was drama. Heartache. Broken friendships… I’m not even touching everything that went wrong. Murphy showed up in full force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: How was the engagement of the attendees?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM:</strong> We sold 200 tickets which was embarrassing for me. I guess it was beyond our control. But my biggest thing is like, why? I feel like a lot of the hiccups and the hurdles, if not walls, that were placed in front of us (that I decided to hurdle-nay, bulldoze over), greatly affected our attendance. So, yeah, we sold 200 tickets when we sold 400 in 2023, so that&#8217;s quite a difference. In our metrics, Fridays always get the most amount of people so Saturday was sad panda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: </strong>Oh, really? Back at WCLAX Saturdays were always more popular and Sundays had a large drop-off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM</strong>: I think people tend to look at Fridays like a work day and think “I’m gonna go to this work conference”. Then Saturday comes and they&#8217;re like, I want to hang with my fam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other thing was the weather. The highs were in the low 50s, and it was raining! Then we had to find awnings for the sponsors, just in case it actually rained when they were there, which thankfully never did happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I&#8217;m being honest, I felt guilty. I felt guilty that we had these two incredible keynote speakers who have been pivotal in the startup and entrepreneurial community in Phoenix from day one. They&#8217;ve always been supporters and sponsored our entire WordPress community and have hosted plenty of our meetups at their co-working spaces. To not have a full audience for them… The same thing with some of our speakers. I know we had a lot of feedback afterward regarding Quinn Tempest, Tanya Moushi, and Perry Collins and how incredible their talks were. All local women to Phoenix… but there weren&#8217;t hundreds of people to watch them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AS: Have you gathered feedback from the event?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM</strong>: Not yet. For the first time ever, I feel burnout (I didn’t think that could happen to me). The team is burnt out. And I have bragged to the world about how amazing our team is, how we don&#8217;t get burnout, how we have each other&#8217;s backs, and how if somebody drops a plate, someone&#8217;s there to help. It just didn&#8217;t happen like that this time around. And it&#8217;s really hard not to blame myself, even though I know and my head knows it&#8217;s not my fault. But my heart feels shame.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AS: Word on the street has it that you toss out the idea or you have the idea to do a regional WordCamp.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM</strong>: Anybody who knows me knows my <em>why</em>. That is human connection. The reason I fell in love with WordPress is because there was this group of humans that genuinely wanted to connect for no reason other than we&#8217;re in this space together. So let&#8217;s connect. And I&#8217;d never experienced that in my life. So I fell head over heels, absolutely in love with this community, and made a career out of it. I love it. I love putting events on and I could do it in my sleep. I could plan an event off the top of my head, you know, a conference. It&#8217;s a labor of love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve had this idea of a regional for a long time. This dates back to pre-pandemic as I knew the rules: you had to have a local camp and you had to have several local camps in an area or region to have a regional and I was like, how cool would that be to have a Southwest region of the United States WordCamp. I remember approaching Matt Cromwell at Pressonomics 6, the very last one in September 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, I got this idea. Because we qualify, and we all love each other, because we&#8217;ve all kind of rotated at each other&#8217;s camps and stuff, and like, it kinda feels like we&#8217;re all in the same neighborhood. What if we had a regional? And I remember he liked it, but mentioned having to get WordCamp San Diego back up. And then he moved to Germany and the pandemic happened.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, then fast forward to now, and we were just, like, gungho, let&#8217;s get Phoenix back, and we did. Then 2024 happens, and kind of coming back to the question you asked earlier if I regret 2024. I do not regret it at all. I love our community. I love my people so deeply. But it was not what we expected. And now I&#8217;m reflecting and know that we need to start doing something different. If everybody&#8217;s burnt out, then we need to change. The pandemic caused a lot of emotional burnout before we even did anything in person. Our community hasn’t fully recovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know what I mean? A lot of the community is just burnt out. Traveling to multiple cities from SoCal to Nevada to Arizona to attend a 1/2-day camp is less attractive. We got used to just chilling in our homes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m on board with the future of WordCamps and the mission that&#8217;s now being laid out, but I want really cool, magical WordCamps still. Maybe it’s a dream? And I&#8217;m cool with it being one larger one (regional) versus a bunch of little ones than to have nothing at all. Which, might be where we end up. Personally, I don&#8217;t want to see a world where WordCamps are essentially a hackathon. That&#8217;s great to have a bunch of those, and I&#8217;m not against it at all. What I&#8217;m against is that only being it. And I&#8217;ll just come out and say it. I don&#8217;t want that to be the only existence of a WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AS: What&#8217;s the status then and what are the next steps for a regional WC to be approved?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM</strong>: Well, back in the day, you had to have several meetups to then have an actual WordCamp. And then you had to have several local WordCamps to have a regional. And it really wasn&#8217;t an issue to a US-based camp. It was more of a Europe situation as my friend, Remkus wanted to have WordCamp Netherlands and had a journey getting that going. And now we&#8217;re seeing WordCamp Canada, right? When I saw Canada was announced, that rekindled my flame.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phoenix is tired. I&#8217;m not tired, but I’m tired of everyone around me being tired and we need more leaders. We need more help. And I love my people. I love my team. We have true friendship with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We deeply love each other. I care about them deeply. And I&#8217;m like, I can&#8217;t keep us going like this without actual help. So my hopelessly endearing self came up with the idea to officially have a WordCamp Southwest Regional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Southwest region has that magic like Phoenix has. THe Phoenix community loves each other,&nbsp; and all these communities of the SW US love each other too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a 13-year-old girl, metaphorically speaking, who always has these big wide eyes in the way I view the world. Full disclosure, I definitely have this nostalgic attachment to the days when we went to each other&#8217;s WordCamps in the 20-teens. I’m working on it. That nostalgia that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it naive of me to think that everyone&#8217;s going to be on board? Probably. But, I&#8217;m still going to go for it and be that <em>all-things-are-possible</em> Raquel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AS: What&#8217;s your timeline for a regional?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RM</strong>: Honestly, I want to start conversations now! But it won’t happen if we don’t have everyone on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br /><strong>AS: Final question, what are your key takeaways from this year&#8217;s WordCamp. </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>RM</strong>: The key takeaways are:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>The community at large is going through a split in emotional ways that are affecting us physically and it sucks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordCamp Phoenix needs more help to continue.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I want to have a regional. I would like our next iteration to be a regional, whether that&#8217;s spring or fall 2025 I&#8217;m not sure, but a girl can dream.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Turns out, I do have a capacity so I am going to take some time and not volunteer so much.

She had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatieKeithBarn2/status/1747682958083789027\">tweeted</a> about her plans to sell the plugins back in January to focus on the more profitable plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://kestrelwp.com/\">Kestrel</a>’s first acquisition. Kestrel is a new venture by the former co-founders of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-skyverge-creator-of-over-60-woocommerce-add-ons\">SkyVerge</a> (creator of over 60 WooCommerce add-ons and acquired by GoDaddy in 2020). Their website describes the team as “a small but mighty team of seasoned WooCommerce professionals — we’re some of the top non-Automattic contributors to the open source WooCommerce project.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The acquisition encompasses five premium plugins and two free plugins, including <a href=\"https://kestrelwp.com/product/variation-prices-woocommerce/\">WooCommerce Variation Prices</a>, <a href=\"https://kestrelwp.com/product/express-shop-page-woocommerce/\">WooCommerce Express Shop Page</a>, <a href=\"https://kestrelwp.com/product/shipping-calculator-woocommerce/\">WooCommerce Shipping Calculator</a>, <a href=\"https://kestrelwp.com/product/product-sample-woocommerce/\">WooCommerce Product Sample</a>, <a href=\"https://kestrelwp.com/product/discontinued-products-woocommerce/\">WooCommerce Discontinued Products</a>, and the free plugins <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-custom-add-to-cart-button/\">WooCommerce Custom Add to Cart Button</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-recent-comments/\">Better Recent Comments</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Katie explained, “it makes sense to put the most resources into the plugins which have the biggest user base and which fit best with our other plugins. As a result, in early 2024 we made a team decision that we should sell some of our plugins to a company who will give them the attention they deserve so that we can concentrate our efforts on providing even greater value and support for our remaining suite of plugins.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the acquisition terms, the existing annual and lifetime customers will continue to receive full support, updates and maintenance from the Kestral team. Barn2 has plans in place for customers who purchased the acquired plugins through bundle plans and the All Access Pass plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Max Rice, Founding Engineer of Kestrel told us, “We’re very excited to jump back into the Woo space with the launch of Kestrel!

With the coming <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">Block Bindings API</a>, things are about to change in a very good way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the Block Bindings API?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to explain the Block Bindings API is to start with a plugin like WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you are building your WooCommerce store and you&#8217;re designing the homepage of your site with blocks. You&#8217;re using a Query Loop to display your most popular products, which means many of the blocks you&#8217;ll be reaching for are probably pulling important custom information about your products- product descriptions, images, galleries, add-to-cart buttons, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, WooCommerce needs to create and manage individual <em>custom</em> blocks for each of those separate pieces of content. That&#8217;s a lot of duplicate code and technological overhead. Plus, as new design tools are added to the block editor, the development team has to go back each release and make sure their custom blocks can support new features properly. Wouldn&#8217;t it make much more sense if they could use core blocks &#8211; like a paragraph, heading, or button block &#8211; and just tell WordPress to &#8220;connect&#8221; that block to the product data?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s just one example of the promise of the Block Bindings API, and custom fields are only one of many use-cases. Once the foundation has been laid, this <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/54536\">feature can extend</a> to all types of data that have been relatively hard to manage in the block editor, from populating post and site information (like Author Name or Featured Image) to helping Synced Patterns become more robust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can dynamic data save time and resources?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the Block Bindings API, I reached out to Scott Kingsley Clark, Lead Developer of the <a href=\"https://pods.io/\">Pods Framework</a> and the driving force behind the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/\">Fields API feature project</a> in WordPress Core. The Fields API proposal circles around a similar issue in WordPress: how can we help developers avoid writing the same code over and over?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the problem that tools like Pods and Advanced Custom Fields rose to solve. They save developers from writing the same custom post type code, custom settings screens, and custom field inputs from scratch on every project. Scott drew the connection between his work and WooCommerce, pointing out that many of the contributors to the Block Binding API are in fact contributors to WooCommerce as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The new WooCommerce Product edit screen is powered by Blocks,&#8221; Scott explains, &#8220;and you can totally see the progression over the releases they’ve done on that feature as they’ve abstracted more things and started to find ways to consolidate, instead of &#8216;every specific field has to be their own specific block&#8217; which has been holding them back.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott has been providing feedback on the API and is working on making sure the Pods Framework has an integration ready to go before WordPress 6.5 releases on March 26th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also asked Iain Poulson, Product Manager for <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/\">Advanced Custom Fields</a>, if we might see ACF&#8217;s custom fields using this API to connect to core blocks in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The ACF team have been following the development of the Block Bindings API closely over the last few months,&#8221; says Iain. &#8220;We’re currently exploring building our own binding source to allow users to use ACF field values to be bound to block attributes, and hope to have a working prototype soon.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was originally a chance that custom fields from plugins like Pods and ACF might work out of the box, but some last minute <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/59326\">security cleanup</a> meant that any plugin with a more custom approach will need to build their own integration with the API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We’re aware of a PR merged today into WordPress core which is likely to mean ACF fields won’t be bindable without this work,&#8221; Iain told me earlier this week. &#8220;We expect the future to change significantly over coming releases of WordPress with new UIs for connections and the ability to update values from the binding itself, all of these features we’d love to bring to ACF users, and will be working with the WordPress core team to make sure we can.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s exciting to know that major plugins are invested in this new API. What&#8217;s also important here is to temper expectations about the API. There&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41236\">long roadmap</a> and plenty of experimentation that needs to happen before we see it deeply embedded in developer workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This is an API without a UI?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the WordPress 6.5 release includes the Block Bindings API in core, we&#8217;re not going to see an actual user interface for this feature just yet. This is still an &#8220;under the hood&#8221; feature, but its inclusion means it&#8217;s ready for plugin and theme developers to start building on top of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 6.5, Block Binding can only be used one of two ways, both of which involve touching a little code:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>You can take the approach <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2024/02/20/introducing-block-bindings-part-1-connecting-custom-fields/\">advocated in the WordPress Developer Blog</a>: switch the block editor into the &#8220;Code editor&#8221; mode and add the binding metadata directly to the block HTML.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can utilize the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-variations/\">Block Variations API</a> to add a version of a core block with your binding metadata already baked in. This will require placing some JavaScript in a theme or plugin, but the benefit is that it &#8220;just works&#8221; once you&#8217;re inside the content editor, because your variation shows up as its own block in the block inserter.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The current implementation only supports four core blocks (Paragraph, Heading, Button, and Image), the truth is that those four blocks are<a href=\"https://gutenstats.blog/\"> some of the most commonly used content</a> blocks and will make up the vast majority of use cases, though other blocks are planned. For end users, this means that any blocks using this API will function exactly like the core blocks they’re already familiar with, a win for usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53300\">tracking issue</a> for the project makes it clear that a no-code interface for the Block Bindings API is coming, with some proof-of-concept examples already being explored. By taking this API-first approach, the core team can see how the feature is used in the wild before committing to change in the block editor, and perhaps take some inspiration as plugin teams build out their own integrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re an end user, you might not notice anything new just yet. But if you&#8217;re a plugin or theme developer, it might be time to explore the Block Bindings API and see if you can&#8217;t take advantage of this time-saving feature.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 17:57:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Brian Coords\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"Do The Woo Community: All Things CloudFest 2024 Hackathon with Christian, Carole and Alain\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=79186\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://dothewoo.io/all-things-cloudfest-2024-hackathon-with-christian-carole-and-alain/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:442:\"<p>CloudFest CEO Christian Jäger joins Carole Olinger and Alain Schlesser for a conversation for the 2024 Hackathon at CloudFest.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/all-things-cloudfest-2024-hackathon-with-christian-carole-and-alain/\">All Things CloudFest 2024 Hackathon with Christian, Carole and Alain</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce and WordPress Builder Podcast</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 07:05:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"WPTavern: WordPress Photo Festival 2024, A Five Part Retrospective, Part 4, Next Generation Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=154538\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-photo-festival-2024-a-five-part-retrospective-part-4-next-generation-events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28784:\"<p>In the penultimate episode of this series I talk with Julia Golomb from the WordPress Community Team about Next Generation WordPress Events.

In this episode, we&#8217;re going to talk with Julia from the community team about next generation WordPress events, what that means, what they are and how you can be involved. There are a lot of great ideas coming out about different things that we can do for events and I&#8217;m really excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So come along with me while we have this conversation. I&#8217;m here with Julia from the community team.  please tell us your, your full name and where you&#8217;re from. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:00:50]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> All right. Hey Topher. My name is Julia Golomb and I am bi-coastal in the US I spend half my time. Well, a little more than half my <span>[00:01:00]</span> time in the Bay area of California, just outside of Oakland, California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the, maybe a third of my time in the Northeast United States, mostly around New Hampshire, outside Boston. Very nice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:12]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> And I know you&#8217;re in the community team, but, what do you do? you know, what&#8217;s your role there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:19]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Yeah. So I am a full time contributor to the WordPress community team and I&#8217;m sponsored by Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So AutomatTic donates my time to work full time with the WordPress community. And my role involves helping meetup organizers and helping WordCamp organizers and WordPress event organizers all over the world, create great events that. Bring folks together to celebrate WordPress and learn from each other and build community and gain inspiration and connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. That&#8217;s very cool. And I&#8217;m also, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m also on the lead organizing team for Word Camp US this year and was for 23 as <span>[00:02:00]</span> well. So I bring that flagship organizing experience too. Yeah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:04]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong>  our, our main story is about,  the photos event that happened, Carla, but I keep hearing the organizers say things like,  second generation event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does that mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:19]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> All right. So glad you asked. In late spring of 2023, the community team kicked off a pilot project that was called NextGen WordPress Events. And the idea of this pilot project was to think outside the box about how WordPress organizers, WordPress enthusiasts around the world can organize events that are different from the traditional WordCamp format and the traditional Meetup format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because previously, those were the two main formats that the community team offered. For word camp event organizers. <span>[00:03:00]</span> The next gen pilot project offered an invitation to organizers around the world to experiment. So we said, bring us your ideas. What sorts of events do you want to see that are different from a word camp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or it could be a word camp, but a different flavor and style of word camp than we&#8217;re used to seeing. And. We at the end of 2023 concluded that pilot project and learned from that experience that yes, the community is thirsty for experimentation and there&#8217;s a lot of an opportunity for different types of events besides WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now we&#8217;re, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:03:40]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> what kinds of things that people do? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:03:45]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Great question.  so I know you are talking about the photo festival. That&#8217;s an example of a. That&#8217;s an example of a next gen event that was part of the pilot project. But I will just say <span>[00:04:00]</span> that now we are we&#8217;ve closed the pilot project stage. And now the community team has created an ongoing invitation to WordPress organizers to organize innovative, creative WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we&#8217;re not. Not even calling them next gen. Although I think people still, that language has stuck, but WordPress events now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:04:29]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s really cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:04:32]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong>  and next gen at the time, the name came up as. It means next generation of WordCamp. So we were so used to work. What&#8217;s the next generation of these events that people learn and connect and build real world skills and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:04:51]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah.  I will admit I love WordCamps. I love the traditional ones, but I haven&#8217;t really been to a session in <span>[00:05:00]</span> years because I&#8217;ve been to so many of them, but I really want to do is hang out with my friends. Yes, and a different kind of event could facilitate that without the guilt of my other friends being in a session that I&#8217;m not listening to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:16]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Absolutely, I&#8217;ll share another example. You asked for some examples. Yeah The photo festival that just concluded in Japan. There&#8217;s a monthly series of community building workshops and those are online events That I think they helped started as online events, but then became in person events and it&#8217;s an opportunity to,  for community members to come together and learn about how they can be community wordpress community organizers across.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, meant to build up the community team and that roster of. Organizers. And in Rome in September of 2023, there was a community day and that was a day <span>[00:06:00]</span> dedicated to WordPress community event organizers. There&#8217;s, ah, coming up in Rome, an event called Core Days. Okay. And that&#8217;s focused on, I believe, focused on core WordPress core contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.  that&#8217;ll be in November of this year. So that&#8217;s a ways from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:06:23]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Okay. That&#8217;s really great. I&#8217;m really glad to hear that because I have thought in the past myself about trying to do a core focused only event that is days long because I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve been to work camps where I joined contributor day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I say, I&#8217;m going to contribute to core today. And eight hours later, I have Docker halfway set up and I&#8217;m lost and I&#8217;ve never contributed anything at any of those, but what if it were four days long and you spent two days getting Docker set up and then <span>[00:07:00]</span> contributing? That would be great. So I&#8217;m really happy to hear that they&#8217;re doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I have to go to Rome. So thank you very much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:07:07]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Yes. And something that we&#8217;ve observed in the U S in particular and North America is that word camps. And meetups have been slow to reenergize and reactivate since. Yes, I&#8217;ve noticed. And I think there&#8217;s gradual momentum building, but the landscape has really changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things are more expensive. Venues are more expensive. Mm-Hmm. Covid was a real disruption in the flow and progression of. WordCamps. And so, I think that WordPress events, more broadly, my hope is that WordPress events offer</p>\n\n\n\n<p>the opportunity for more creativity for, for organizers to think about what is it that their community really wants and needs and what will enable <span>[00:08:00]</span> people to come out of their houses. Right. And working from home to actually be together. What are the skills that folks are looking to build? For example, I&#8217;ve heard a New York city meetup organizer talk about the possibility of organizing an event that targets recent graduates who are looking for jobs and, and want to learn about how WordPress can actually help them gain employment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s something that is different that people can&#8217;t just go on YouTube for like identifying what is the real value that this particular community. Is looking for and how to Yeah, like a more targeted event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:08:43]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> That&#8217;s a great idea because looking back, basically every session I&#8217;ve ever given, talked at could be just a YouTube video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if we can make something that you can&#8217;t get on YouTube, that&#8217;s going to be really valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:08:57]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Yes. And so it really depends on creativity. It really <span>[00:09:00]</span> depends on an organizer in the box and trying something new and experimenting. And probably some events won&#8217;t. Won&#8217;t work so well. And that&#8217;s okay because that&#8217;s a learning and I hope that organizers will share their learnings with the community through posts on make a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, from the community team recently posted a recap of the Jakarta WordPress website challenge. Website pitching competition. That was just held in January. And Devon&#8217;s share is it&#8217;s great. She really shares a lot of good info and good, good lessons learned. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:38]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> That&#8217;s really great.  I I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve talked to a number of organizers since COVID during COVID and things, and have heard, as you mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much more expensive things are a venue or food?  I think, I <span>[00:10:00]</span> think I heard a meetup for an evening in London, England was going to be 10, 000 or something. And yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s outrageous and New York City is the same.  the organizers there will have a cap on their meetup of 10 people because they, their, their room doesn&#8217;t hold more than 10 and it&#8217;s 2, 000 for the evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 10 people to get together and chat. So we, you know, we need the creativity. So,  I would love to hear if you can tell me some of the financially creative things people are doing to have a great time, get good things done without spending 10, 000 an evening for a meetup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:10:44]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Absolutely. Well, sponsorship, I will start by saying the WordPress events program depends on our sponsors and really important to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that that&#8217;s a reciprocal relationship. <span>[00:11:00]</span> So think about how can we, what value do sponsors receive from their sponsorship and how can community events support our sponsors? Our sponsors are part of the WordPress ecosystem, just like the rest of us. Right. That&#8217;s one piece.  sponsorships are really important and that could be an in kind sponsorship of donating a venue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t need to be. It doesn&#8217;t only need to come in the form of financial or monetary. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:30]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> That would be so cool. Like I&#8217;m on meetups at the WP engine office or the Automattic office in San Francisco.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:39]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Yes. And I&#8217;m here in the Bay area and I&#8217;m really trying to get the San Francisco meetup reactivated. And I, it is amazing to know that the Automattic space in San Francisco could be made available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And similarly, Automattic is offered to donate the know how right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:59]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> <span>[00:12:00]</span> Yeah. In New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:00]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Yeah. Yep. So it&#8217;s a resource. It&#8217;s a space that&#8217;s available and takes a little bit of coordination, but it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s there for the New York city meetup organizers. So my first encouragement for. Organizers. There&#8217;s a couple, there&#8217;s many things I want to say here, but my first encouragement is think about how you can find a donated space and okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number two around finances, they are, the landscape is different and I do budget reviews often with meetup organizers and I mentor WordCamps and help them shape their budgets. And the community team recently has been telling organizers, sharing with organizers, what we observe because we&#8217;re working with a lot of different WordCamps and WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I patterns. And one of the patterns is there&#8217;s less sponsorship, money available now than There used to be another pattern is that WordCamp <span>[00:13:00]</span> organizers really want to organize several hundred person events and it is. It&#8217;s just not there. And that is okay. Small events are so meaningful and important and impactful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I could not measure the success of an event by the number of attendees. I would set expectations, encourage organizers to set expectations at the outset for number of attendees. And understand that a 100 person event is, from my, absolutely from my perspective, as important and valuable as a 500 person event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. And I&#8217;m just going to pause and, and think for a moment. There&#8217;s something I want to say around this. All that to say, I think that creative WordPress events are really helpful for shifting out of the mindset of like the idea that, oh, it needs to be a WordCamp and that a WordCamp needs to be a big endeavor that feeds people and maybe is multiple days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress <span>[00:14:00]</span> events open up the possibility of offering or organizing a half day workshop. That is specifically for digital marketers or a half day session that&#8217;s about building job skills, or is for folks focused on SEO, or want to contribute to the WordPress photo, photos team, photos library. There&#8217;s, there&#8217;s so much that can be done that can be low budget and still really rewarding and impactful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:14:37]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> That&#8217;s really, really cool.  I&#8217;ve always wanted to do a, a seminar or whatever in my city on WordPress as a career. Maybe you&#8217;re laid off, maybe you&#8217;re just out of college, maybe you&#8217;re just out of high school. What do I want to do? I don&#8217;t want to do what I was doing before is web development for <span>[00:15:00]</span> me, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:15:01]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> It sounds like you&#8217;ve got some really good ideas. I want to see you organize a WordPress event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:15:08]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah, wow, that&#8217;s another thing all together. I want to see WordCamp San Francisco, so. You do yours. I&#8217;ll do mine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:15:16]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> And my idea for WordCamp San Francisco is that it would be small. I&#8217;m thinking like, I know WordCamp San Francisco used to be hundreds of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love to start with a one day. WordCamp San Francisco at the Automattic space, the Automattic office of the mission, which people that can accommodate maybe a 100 and fewer than 100, keep it a one track one day gathering. That&#8217;s about bringing community together and creating the Bay area WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it, it, it doesn&#8217;t need to be, I&#8217;m not benchmarking it against something that happened in the past and thinking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:15:55]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> It was, it was the flagship. Yeah, you know, you&#8217;re not going to do that again, <span>[00:16:00]</span> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:01]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> but but just having any event that brings people together in the Bay Area would be so meaningful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is what the world, any event that brings people together is meaningful, whether it&#8217;s 50 people or people are 150. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:16]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So I want to take what you&#8217;ve said here and abstract it back to the photos event.  there was no venue, so that was not a thing. We didn&#8217;t, you know, there&#8217;s no money spent on a venue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> the, I don&#8217;t know, I want to say talks. The, it was like, there was a few talks on the first day and a few at the last day, but there wasn&#8217;t a time when everybody sat in front of their computer for six hours and listened to people talk.  people got out, got outside, wandered around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and I, and I know they they mentioned that they were going to do <span>[00:17:00]</span> some ads by ad space to get people to participate, but they got so many people just by word of mouth that they didn&#8217;t need that money for that. And so they&#8217;re right there and there&#8217;s, you know, pushing back the financials.  and a testament to their, their ability to get the word out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> they did a great job.  given the number of people around the world, it would, it seems like it&#8217;d be hard to To make it really international and they did a good job. I was very impressed. I was sick. I was at death&#8217;s door through that whole week and I was very sad. So I missed it all.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:40]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> you made it to the other side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m glad you did not walk through death&#8217;s door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:42]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yes.  I should have at the last minute to be a judge and that&#8217;s it. But,  but you know, I got to see that. I got to hear. hear them in a zoom meeting talking about it and, and things like that. And,  now I get to do this event. So <span>[00:18:00]</span> I&#8217;ve been talking for a while now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> tell me some of the things that made the photos thing really stand out as a great model for next gen events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:18:13]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Yeah. Oh, so many, so many things.  the first is that it is such a creative format. It&#8217;s new, it&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;d never seen before as a WordPress event. It was targeted. It had a very specific, the communication around it was very clear about what it was and how to get involved, including for folks for whom it was the first time contributing to the WordPress photo library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.  in fact, I contributed my first photo. I don&#8217;t think I officially registered for the event, but it inspired me to contribute my cat. Yeah. And then I looked through at all the other cat photos that had been uploaded. <span>[00:19:00]</span> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:01]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So cool. It needs more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:02]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> I can help you out with that. There&#8217;s a lot. Yeah, a lot of WordPress can help you out with cat photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s for sure. So one thing was simply like the outside of the box thinking to come up with the way in which it was regionally targeted and yet online so that I felt like folks around the world were invested in it and could participate in it but also had a sense of Interest. So it&#8217;s sure. Interest to folks all over the world, super low budget online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I do, I think there&#8217;s a huge value to in person events too. So I am not by any means saying we should have online events and not a mix of both is useful. And this was a really engaging online event. It&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s not something that. You can go onto YouTube and find it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an interactive format where everybody contributes and learns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:00]</span>  those are some of the pieces that I would highlight and it&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s fun and rewarding and interactive. And I love all of that. I think it was just fantastic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:15]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah, it was really fun to watch all of all the pictures come in and see everybody do everything.  I have an RSS feed of. Of everything it&#8217;s the fire hose and for until now it&#8217;s been 30 or 40 a day and I just go through them every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I was at 2000 photos to view after the end of the event and I&#8217;m down to 980 now. But it is fun to see everybody&#8217;s photos to see their home, you know, not their house, but you know, like where they&#8217;re from what they do Yes, and takes so many pictures of Southern California mountains, <span>[00:21:00]</span> and they&#8217;re great and Bigel he lives in Kerala, but it&#8217;s so many photos from Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re all over the place And now I want to, I want to have a conversation with him, you know, tell me about this.  so yeah, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:21:19]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> This is something that is really cool about that particular event format or event type. It connects people socially. So it&#8217;s, it really is a way of getting a glimpse into people&#8217;s lives, a glimpse into what people care about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a personal touch to it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:21:39]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> And what&#8217;s interesting to me is that when I think about personal touch in WordCamps, I think in person. We have a conversation, you touch someone&#8217;s shoulder, but you&#8217;re never going to sit at a WordCamp and look at an iPad for an hour of their photos. You know, but you would at home, you know, you&#8217;ll flip through <span>[00:22:00]</span> a couple of hundred photos from the day of an event and see where everybody was and what they did and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a different, it&#8217;s a very personal thing. You&#8217;re not gonna get in person. I think that&#8217;s pretty cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:22:13]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> I agree. I&#8217;d like to ask big, who is the organizer of the event to write a recap for the community team page around Sure. What the, was like organizing it and what, what lessons did he learn? What were the successes, what might he do differently at really with the purpose of inspiring other folks to organize events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not the same type of event, but Mm-Hmm. to think about what, what are they passionate about? That Yeah. They, and bring people together around. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:22:43]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of wisdom there from now. Now people have done it.  I have already interviewed him So if you keep your eye on the tavern in the next few days You&#8217;ll see All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:23:00]</span> I don&#8217;t know that I have anything more for you Have I mentioned at the beginning? I don&#8217;t know a whole lot about next gen. Did I miss anything? Anything you need to get out there? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:23:12]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Let&#8217;s see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a last piece, which is the idea of these other WordPress event types. Is that we really want WordPress events that are, that don&#8217;t require too great of an effort by organizers. So they&#8217;re doable, right? Are workable, meaning if an event inspires somebody across the globe or across the country, or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Down the road from you that another organizer could replicate it. Right. Available. Meaning that if you wait, say that word again. Scalable, so scalable, meaning if 10 people participate, that&#8217;s great. If you want to grow the event or someone else wants to grow an event, a similar event and have 100 people <span>[00:24:00]</span> participate, that could work as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then desirable for attendees, meaning it serves a purpose, it offers some value to attendees, that value could be Tangible skills or knowledge. It could be connection. It could be job offers. There&#8217;s, it could be contribution. There&#8217;s so many different ways to offer value to attendees, desirable and meaningful to the attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So doable, replicable, scalable, and desirable. Those are the key metrics for what would be a successful WordPress event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:24:35]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Well done. I&#8217;ll put those in bullet points on the screen. All right.  I did think of one more thing.  I was thinking about more Photos events. Do, do we want to have many per year or one per year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p> despite the fact that this was an international event, A lot of <span>[00:25:00]</span> Indians were took took place because it was based in Kerala, which makes sense. And I almost think I&#8217;d like to see it be sort of like flagship events, but there&#8217;s a city that organizes it and it&#8217;s still international, but. It&#8217;s not big and his team, you know what I mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s and, and we would end up seeing a lot of photos of each, like the city that it&#8217;s in as well as international. But I&#8217;d like to see it move around and have it be organized by different people. And I don&#8217;t know if we could handle more than a, more than one a month, it would kill us. . </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:25:46]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Yeah.  you say it would kill us, you, the photos, the photo team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:25:50]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Do you know,  Michelle Frechette, of course. Yes, she personally moderated 1, <span>[00:26:00]</span> 200 photos last week. That&#8217;s just insane. A lot of photos. And so we would need a much larger moderator team if we were gonna You know, ramp this up, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:15]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong>  next to the idea of the WordPress event being replicable. The idea that right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We quit big old created and replicate it elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:29]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Wow. This has been really great. I&#8217;m really excited.  yeah, I&#8217;ve had a ton of ideas over the years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:37]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Yay. And if your readers, listeners, viewers are inspired by event. Yeah. and this conversation . They can apply to organize a WordPress event and, and where each team receives those applications. We vet them and then we follow up with that orientation and get them <span>[00:27:00]</span> going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And really like I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll share, I&#8217;ll let you know where they can apply. But one thing I want to. I really encourage organizers to think about events that are manageable, that will not cause burnout, that will not be too stressful. And having low cost events is a really good way to help manage that stress level, because the more expensive an event is, the more stressful it gets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More more on the line, right? Doable piece like we want organizers to find the process of organizing event to be so rewarding and for them to want to come back and do it again next year and and managing managing burnout, making managing overwhelm, making sure that event is. It&#8217;s doable. It&#8217;s a really good way to support that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where, where can they, where can somebody apply?  I have to find the link. So <span>[00:28:00]</span> this is going to, would, could I? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:02]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> You can send it to me later. I&#8217;ll put it on the screen.  during editing because editing is magic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:10]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Yeah. That&#8217;s indeed. I&#8217;ve got it right here. Okay. I will say if folks have questions also, they can always come to the community events channel and slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a great place to, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:21]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Oh, that is a great place. Yes. You&#8217;re right. Many eyes from all. Yeah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Well, thank you very much for being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:31]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Thank you so much. This was awesome. It&#8217;s so fun to talk to with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:35]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah, it is fun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:37]</span> <strong>Julia:</strong> Cool. Well, good luck. I hope you have a great rest of your day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:40]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> You too. And that&#8217;s it for today&#8217;s episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for stopping by.

Dollar bills are laying around the laptop.\" class=\"wp-image-154507\" />Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/macbook-pro-dDvrIJbSCkg\">Kenny Eliason</a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"as-valuable-as-1-big-project-per-year\">As Valuable as 1 Big Project Per Year</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Barbara Schendel-Kent didn’t start out looking to become a plugin developer, but she now runs a successful plugin business that supplements her WP consulting income.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 years ago, Schendel hired a freelance developer to code the initial iteration of her popular Beaver Builder Mega Menu plugin for a client site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I needed a specific plugin, and it didn&#8217;t exist,” says Schendel-Kent of how she got into the plugin business. After activating the plugin on her client’s website, she asked the developer to round out the plugin’s functionality to get it ready to sell on her own website. Overall, it’s been a big win for Schendel-Kent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Beaver Builder Mega Menu has continued to bring in one big project’s worth of revenue every year,” she says. That’s significant for a plugin that requires very little upkeep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It was an accident and very much an experiment,” added Schendel-Kent. “I was surprised by how few problems there were in the beginning.&nbsp; Most of the support requests were feature requests, not bugs.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"building-shopwp-into-a-full-time-job\">Building ShopWP Into a Full-Time Job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It took 6 years of intensive work, but ShopWP developer, Andrew Robbins, is finally at a point where his WordPress-to-Shopify connector plugin is making enough money to support his family, including purchasing a home to live in.&nbsp; Additionally, as his plugin’s success has grown, so have his ambitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I want ShopWP to be a direct competitor with WooCommerce, even though I&#8217;m nowhere near their market share yet,” says Robbins.&nbsp; “I see ShopWP as empowering small business owners &#8211; giving them a beautiful and powerful online shop that rivals their larger competitors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another successful plugin developer takes a more modest approach and points out some struggles small plugin businesses encounter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It has become difficult to reach new clients who are overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of plugins available,” says Milan Petrovic, a developer who makes the bulk of his living selling his WP plugins on his website, Dev4Press.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Big companies can pour a lot of money into advertising…It is almost impossible to find websites that have honest, not-paid-for reviews of premium plugins,” adds Petrovic. “The chance of ending up with a bad plugin [based on reviews on a website] is quite high.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some plugin business owners see lots of opportunities for small businesses to promote their plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Having a free plugin in WP.org is a great place to start,” says Jesse Sutherland, an app and plugin developer who successfully sold 2 WP plugins in 2023. “For example, if you link back to your website from your wp.org page, that’s a valuable link.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to say it’s easy, as you might need to stretch your marketing muscles to make it work for your specific business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Before embarking on writing the plugins I sold last year, I did do some keyword research to make sure this was a plugin people were looking for,” Sutherland says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, there are ways to outmaneuver the big players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Getting on some of the ‘Top 10 List’ sites is helpful, even if it’s a ‘You scratch my back, I scratch yours’ thing or maybe a thing where you trade links.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes paying is the best way to get your brand out, but you don’t need to spend millions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Paying to get listed on a ‘Top 10’ website or developing a partnership deal or affiliate program are great ways to get people interested in buying your plugin,” Sutherland adds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Stickers of WordPress from WordCamp Asia & WordCamp Sylhet\" class=\"wp-image-154514\" />Photo by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/111647dbab/\">Mohammad Adil morshed</a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"it-s-never-too-late-to-start-marketing-your-plugin\">It’s never too late to start marketing your plugin.&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“I&#8217;ve worked on ShopWP for around 6 years, and I&#8217;m just now implementing some level of product marketing,” Robbins says. “It&#8217;s not even that I was unaware of the importance of doing it; it was pure procrastination.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robbins has also been able to increase revenue for his business through strategic price increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I raised my prices in 2021 and, to my surprise, people didn&#8217;t bat an eye,” Robbins says. “Not only did this help me grow ShopWP, but it was a psychological relief to know that people were still willing to purchase my product, even at the elevated price.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you just get lucky when you create something good.&nbsp; The aforementioned Beaver Builder Mega Menu plugin garnered some unexpected praise and a P.R. boost from the official <em>Beaver Builder</em> website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Beaver Builder created a special blog post on their site with a video walkthrough with how to use my plugin,” the plugin’s owner, Schendel-Kent says.&nbsp; “This was such a compliment that they not only spent the time to write the article but also to create the video.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t even ask them to!&nbsp; That was validating.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"you-don-t-need-to-know-code-to-build-a-successful-wp-plugin-business\">You don&#8217;t need to know code to build a successful WP plugin business.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, Schendel didn’t write any of the initial code for Beaver Builder Mega Menu, and over the years, “99% of the code was written by other developers,” she says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Maybe you write no code, but you&#8217;ve got a decent bedside manner and business sense,” Schendel says. “You don&#8217;t need to be a coder to write and sell a plugin.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you could be the primary developer of a plugin and transition out of that role. Vova Feldman, who runs Freemius, a sass service that takes care of the e-commerce and licensing parts of selling WP plugins, started out writing the code for his nascent platform, however, as the years passed, he moved into a non-coding role.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our team has grown to 20 passionate individuals, and my role has evolved dramatically,” Feldman says. “Coding has taken a backseat to facilitating communication, coaching our team, recruiting new talent, and engaging with partners.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s been a reminder that making oneself ‘redundant’ is not a step back but a leap towards a future where everyone shines brighter together,” Feldman says of his business’ journey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making himself ‘redundant’ allowed Feldman to do something that many business owners dream of: taking personal time.&nbsp; “Taking time off for a vacation or parental leave, which I did last March when I welcomed my baby boy into the world, is no longer a source of stress,” Feldman says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"becoming-a-successful-plugin-developer-is-not-without-its-challenges\">Becoming a Successful Plugin Developer Is Not Without Its Challenges</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“The first major difference I noticed early on was the uncertainty,” says Robbins of his ShopWP plugin business early on. “With consulting work, being paid was never really in question. My customers were largely business owners or larger companies, and the income was very predictable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years Robbins continued earning the bulk of his revenue consulting while working on ShopWP on the side.&nbsp; This was done simply because, at first, ShopWP didn’t earn living wage revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The early years of ShopWP were basically the opposite [of the consulting business]. ShopWP’s income was rare and unpredictable,” he says. “Even when a sale came through, I had to deal with the looming uncertainty of issuing refunds.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“However, now that ShopWP has matured a bit, the income is both predictable and provides even more freedom than the consulting work,” adds Robbins. “So it&#8217;s definitely a long-term investment that (hopefully) continues to pay off.”</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ilya-pavlov-OqtafYT5kTw-unsplash-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"A laptop screen with lots of code on it.\" class=\"wp-image-154513\" />Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/monitor-showing-java-programming-OqtafYT5kTw\">Ilya Pavlov</a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"supporting-and-maintaining-wp-plugins-can-be-difficult\">Supporting and Maintaining WP Plugins Can Be Difficult&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“One of the biggest challenges with developing plugins for the WordPress community is that you have so little control over the server environments where your code will live,” says Natalie MacLees, COO and founder of N², which sells the <em>Simply Schedule Appointments</em> and <em>Draw Attention</em> WP plugins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There are potentially multiple versions of PHP, different MySQL setups, all kinds of different server configurations, and thousands of different plugins and themes with which you need to make sure your code is compatible,” MacLees says. “It’s really challenging as a small company to have the bandwidth and budget to do extensive testing for all of these different variables.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential problems grow as your plugin’s reach expands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Early on, when our plugins had less than 100 active installs, the potential impact of releasing a bug or a poorly implemented feature was pretty small,” MacLees says. “But once our plugins became more popular and had tens of thousands of active installs, the potential impact of a bug became a lot greater and could easily overwhelm our support team and leave us with a lot of unhappy customers who are in need of urgent fixes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens when you are the only developer of a plugin and you need to take a sick day?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If I get sick and can&#8217;t work for three days, I&#8217;ll usually lose about a week&#8217;s worth of time to getting caught up with customer support,” says Robbins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, adding to plugin developer workload, expectations around web accessibility seem to be increasing as the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar legislation is applied to websites &#8211; and as more and more lawyers get involved in suing businesses large and small. For example, both <em>Target</em> and <em>Domino&#8217;s Pizza</em> lost website-related ADA lawsuits recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress consultant, Matt Christenson, recently helped a business resolve some web accessibility issues related to an ADA compliance lawsuit.&nbsp; He shares a recent story where, even with the best of intentions and efforts to bring a website into ADA compliance, a company was the target of an ADA compliance lawsuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“An ADA compliance lawsuit is a major headache,” Christenson says.&nbsp; “One client of mine had to hire an attorney and another developer &#8211; hundreds of hours were invested &#8211; it was a bad situation all around.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn’t mean you should shy away from plugin development due to web accessibility concerns.&nbsp; Christensen says web accessibility skills are learnable and will work their way into your workflow with some education and diligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It takes a bit more research on the front end to educate yourself about the WCAG compliance criteria,” Christenson says while expressing that the bulk of web accessibility problems are common and correctable. “For example, font icons need a ‘role=’ tag on them,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing your plugin into reasonable compliance with ADA guidelines doesn’t need to be overwhelming or break the bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web accessibility consultant and member of the Make WordPress Accessible team, Joe Dolson, recently <a href=\"https://themightymo.com/why-is-web-accessibility-important/\">simplified web accessibility basics into 3 simple points</a> that can fit on a 3&#215;5 card:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>“<strong>Everything needs a name that describes what it does.</strong> If you have a link, the text should make it clear where that link goes. If you have a button, it should have text that clearly indicates what happens. Labels, alternative text, aria-label attributes – all methods of providing an accessible name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use native elements for interaction. </strong>Buttons should be ‘button’ or ‘input’. Links should be ‘a href=”‘. Building an accordion? Put a button inside a heading; don’t just add a click event to the heading.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use HTML to structure your documents. </strong>Headings are there for a reason: they provide an outline of your document and give context for the following content. Don’t just use a heading because you want large text.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"don-t-forget-the-exit\">Don’t Forget the Exit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to making money while you run a WP plugin business, there are potential earnings for you on the back end as well &#8211; the potential to sell your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entrepreneur and app developer, Jesse Sutherland, successfully developed and sold 2 WP themes and 2 WP plugins over the last few years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The process of selling the WP themes and plugins was pretty smooth,” Sutherland said.&nbsp; “I think both parties were happy, and I would do it again.”</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/heart-key.jpg\" alt=\"Computer key cap with a pixel-art heart on a wooden table.\" class=\"wp-image-154509\" />Photo by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/29565c512f/\">Nilo Velez</a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"you-ve-got-this\">You’ve Got This</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WP plugin business owners mostly seem to find the experience of developing a WP plugin to be worthwhile and valuable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My favorite part of running a WordPress business is being able to cultivate and grow something of my own,” says Robbins. “I get to work on a codebase that I enjoy every day, and the only people I have to answer to are my customers. That&#8217;s a very rewarding feeling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m most proud that it took off, that it&#8217;s self-sustaining, that it didn&#8217;t start on fire and implode,” Schendel concluded, only a little bit tongue-in-cheek.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-experiences-have-you-had-selling-wp-plugins-let-us-know-in-the-comments\">What Experiences Have You Had Selling WP Plugins?

This is the web I’ve always wanted to see.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/state-of-the-word/\">State of the Word 2023</a> keynote, Matt Mullenweg pulled a Steve Jobs move, revealing Data Liberation, an initiative he described as the thing he’s most excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“In 2024, we want to unlock the web through a dedicated focus on migration tools. We want to make first-party community plugins, tools, and workflows available o</em>n <em>WordPress.org [&#8230;] I want it to be seamless, straightforward, and as zero friction as possible.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg promised that WordPress.org would take these projects under its wings, provide each with a dedicated Slack channel and GitHub repository on its official platforms, and ensure a swift review process of about one business day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/01/data-liberation-in-2024/\">In a post published</a> shortly after the event, Mullenweg laid an even more ambitious plan:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Migrating your site to WordPress, or exporting all your content from WordPress, should be possible in one click. I want WordPress’ export format to become the lingua franca of CMSes, whether coming to WordPress or moving within WordPress.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[&#8230;] it should be more than plugins; workflows, tutorials, and helper scripts should be shared, too. I want this resource to have space to include moving from social networks, moving from a page builder to core blocks, switching from classic to blocks, and improving WordPress current canonical plugins for importing.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">We’ve Only Just Begun</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot of work: the guides on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\">Data Liberation website</a> are mostly outlines, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/data-liberation\">waiting for contributors</a> to materialize the team’s good intentions. The recently updated <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/import/\">Importing Content</a> guide on the WordPress Developer Resources website includes obsolete services and links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigate to <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Import</strong>, and you’ll get a similar blast from the past looking at the importing tools on offer: Blogger, LiveJournal, Movable Type and TypePad. If you have a website hosted on WordPress.com, you’ll get support for a handful of contemporary platforms, including Medium, Squarespace, Substack, and Wix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors made a little spring clean in 2021, moving the code of these and other somewhat relevant importers from SVN <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress?q=importer&type=all&language=&sort=\">to GitHub</a>, where it’s easier to maintain. But that’s barely scratching the surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s needed now is traction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Calling All Hosting Companies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post titled <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/19/data-liberation-next-steps/\">Data Liberation Next Steps</a>, project leader Jordan Gillman introduced a few high-level paths forward:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A proposal to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/data-liberation/discussions/53\">use Playground as a migration tool</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/data-liberation/discussions/55\">hybrid approach</a> that involves auto-detecting the source platform and guiding users through the process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A discussion about <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/data-liberation/discussions/56\">improvements to WXR (WordPress eXtended RSS)</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still no concrete timelines and not everybody in the community is thrilled, but we decided to reach out to Gillman to get some more answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s the current status of the project?</strong><br />“There’s been a conversation about how to approach data liberation across teams. I’m hoping to bring those conversations together to brainstorm and more concretely plan what the project actually looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, the response has been really positive. However, getting buy-in from plugin developers and other stakeholders will continue to be a priority for this project. The first initial challenge is one of coordination; this is going to be a collaborative project (by design), which means drawing folks and companies together to define the path forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll be at WordCamp Asia next week, and look forward to chatting with folks in person!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are there plans to collaborate with other online platforms (open source or commercial) to promote this initiative and make it a reality? I imagine a utopian scenario where WordPress leadership sits down with major players in the industry to create a standard—something<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/08/concerns-over-the-european-unions-cyber-resilience-act-cra/\"> along the lines of the efforts made in the case of the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act</a>.</strong><br />“Data Liberation could be an opportunity to lead by example. And since WordPress is doing this publicly, anyone can share updates about this work. That really means that how we go about this project today needs to be with that broader picture in mind.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you considered starting with a universal content migration solution instead of the more ambitious data objective?</strong><br />“At this stage, the focus is on addressing the goal of migrating sites to WordPress or exporting all content from WordPress in one click, thus simplifying the process of transferring content between platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of ‘universal’ content migration, I think conversations about the WXR Import/Export format are really valuable. I’m also excited about the potential of<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/playground/\"> WordPress Playground</a>, which uses a ZIP file for migrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this is an ongoing project and that these efforts don&#8217;t exclude bigger goals related to &#8216;data.&#8217; They provide a tangible starting point, with small, achievable phases to actively involve contributors in progressing toward our broader goals.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You ended the post with questions. How would you answer the last two?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>With such a broad scope, what should be focused on with the highest priority?</strong><br />“One thing that I’m particularly excited about is pulling the disparate plugins, guides, and tools and unifying them in an interface to simplify the experience for users in the migration process. A user shouldn’t have to go searching for the right tool (or combination of tools); we should be able to direct them to the appropriate solution, and walk them through the process!”<br /></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>What other voices should be heard on this topic?</strong><br />“I hope that this question prompts voices from individuals and groups that I haven&#8217;t already thought of. I&#8217;m also keen to hear from web hosts. Given their daily management of migrations for customers, I believe they have insights into pain points, popular platforms (and how they could help), and valuable tools and workarounds that could benefit the wider community.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Radical Ethos</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Manton Reece, the creator of Micro.blog, recently wrote about why and how he uses <em>Blog Archive format (.bar)</em>, a format<a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html\"> he developed in 2017</a>, hoping it would become universal. Apparently, Dave Winer, co-author of the RSS format, <a href=\"https://cagrimmett.com/micro/aa2835f451/#comment-34471\">had similar ideas</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the keynote, Mullenweg made clear that more than a technical vision, Data Liberation is an ethical commitment. “Data Liberation is not just about building the tools, it’s about cultivating a community ethos.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/01/letter-from-wordpress-executive-director-2022/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy</a>, the Executive Director of the WordPress project, expressed a similar sentiment in her post-event letter:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“There’s an extent to which the idea of owning your content and data online is a radical idea. Securing an open web for the future is, I believe, a net win for the world especially when contrasted to the walled gardens and proprietary systems that pit us all against one another with the purpose of gaining more data to sell.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Their words echo core contributor Gary Pendergast’s moral obligation to web users from 2021.<a href=\"https://pento.net/2021/01/18/wordpress-importers-stating-the-problem/\"> In a 4-part series</a>, Pendergast draws a neat circle around the open web advocates’ shared visions: he explores the history of a category of tools he calls WordPress Importers, outlines the problems, and eventually shares a solution:<a href=\"https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech\"> An experimental browser extension</a> that exports data from Wix using its API.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Some services [&#8230;] don’t allow you to export your own content. Other services provide incomplete or fragmented exports, needlessly forcing stress upon site owners [&#8230;]</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When a CMS actively works against providing such freedom to their community, I would argue that we have an obligation to help that community out.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>WordPress doesn’t exist in a vacuum, we’re part of a broad ecosystem which can only exist through the web remaining open and free. By encouraging all CMSes to provide proper exports, and implementing them for those that don’t, we help keep our ecosystem healthy.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Between rescuing users from vendor lock-in and fostering a healthy ecosystem, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress.org</a> is in a perfect position to take the lead on such an undertaking and support, fund, and promote it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Software Can Do that</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the philosophical problems out of the way and the potential to solve the commercial ones on the horizon, we’re left with the technical issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary pain point of WXR is the lack of media support, but once you start considering newer tech stacks, this suddenly seems like the least of everyone’s problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s present these players:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management\">W3Tech places</a> WordPress (43.2%), Shopify (4.3%), and Wix (2.6%) as the top three most used CMSs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>BuiltWith’s dataset shows that Webflow is number 15 on the list of CMS used across the <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/cms\">top 1 million sites crawled</a>, and Contentful is number 26.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://webtechsurvey.com/technology-type/headless-cms\">WebTechSurvey’s analysis</a> reports that 42,900 of the 31,758,591 websites that use a CMS opt for headless CMS, with Ghost leading the market (41.05%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Buzzing with hype, these tools that many—not just younger—developers are touting are almost missing from the project’s repository. So far, it hasn’t attracted interest from people working with headless CMSs like Ghost, Sanity, or Prismic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trendy site builders, like Webflow or Storyblok, steadily gaining traction among product-oriented teams, are also absent. Less restrictive than their predecessors, they share their mean inclination to make it harder to move away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Migrating to and from these new platforms presents new challenges, including mapping custom schemas and supporting discrete file types (RSS/XML, JSON, CSV, markdown, HTML).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of that is impossible to resolve; that’s what software is for. But there is one more obstacle: the knowledge gap between those who possess a deep understanding of Gutenberg, its architecture, and design principles, and all the others, including some core contributors and plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an interesting <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C069AKUBPHB/p1702439016569189\">discussion on the project’s Slack channel</a>, Automattic’s Software Design Engineer, Dennis Snell, demonstrated how invaluable it is to keep this initiative as collaborative and wide-reaching as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thank You For Choosing WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are still early days, but the Data Liberation initiative is a rare political act, and how the platform’s leadership frames it is inspiring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When billion-dollar corporations gobble up as much data as they can store on their servers, it’s almost defiant to invest time and money in making it easier for people to do with their data—their business, their thoughts—as they wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information, generated by these bits of data and serving as the foundation of knowledge, doesn’t want to be free.

In this episode, we&#8217;re going to talk to some attendees about what their experience was taking part in the event, getting photos uploaded and understanding how it all works. So if you could tell me your full name and where you live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:00:44]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> My name is Aishankar and I live in Kochi, India, which is in the southern part of India in a city called Kerala. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:00:51]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. So you were near the center of all the action, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:00:56]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> Yes. Yes. I saw, yes, I was, I was, I&#8217;ve <span>[00:01:00]</span> been in the center of the action, literally and figuratively. So definitely. So, because I live in the center of Kerala as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes. Okay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:09]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So, um, I want to talk to you because you were an attendee and there must surely have been a wide variety of kinds of attendees because there are some people who are far away by themselves. Others were in a group. Um, what? Okay, first of all, how many photos did you submit? One? A hundred?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:33]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> Somewhere closer to one than hundred, but if I can give you the exact number, exactly nine photos, if memory serves me right. I submitted ten, one got rejected, so nine </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:42]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> were approved. So in Kochi, in Kerala, were there groups of people who went out and did photo walks? Or was it all singles everywhere? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:56]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> I believe we had folks contributing single photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:00]</span> Uh, But as, as a local community, we did have photo walks before the photo festival event, which were held by local meetups, especially the Cori code meetup. So those folks went on photo walks and they&#8217;ve had a couple of events where they did it. But for this event specifically, I don&#8217;t think there were photo walks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mostly we had folks contributing photos individually. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:22]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Sure. That&#8217;s very interesting. I would have expected, um, people to get together because, uh, sort of, sort of put together by your community. Yes, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:31]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> it was an idea that was floated though, but this was mostly an online event. We, uh, there was, there was some talks of having local events, local in person, um, gatherings to contribute photos, but due to the logistic side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online mates made more sense, especially for this event. So we had folks trying to do it online, but it does sound like a great idea to have an in person aspect to this community building, especially for an online global event. So for the next photo <span>[00:03:00]</span> festival, I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s going to be an in person part of it and photo walks and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:03:04]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So if you do that, do me a favor. Get everyone into a group and take their, a group photo with their back to the camera. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:03:13]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> Ooh. There&#8217;s a, then you can put it up on the project. That would be nice. Uh, there&#8217;s actually a very famous, one of the, one of the most famous Bollywood movies, which has a scene like this where like the three protagonists, so they&#8217;re like three musketeers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like they show their backs to the camera. There&#8217;s an iconic photo. Uh, the movie is called three idiots. So, yeah, we&#8217;re going to do that like a bunch of open source lovers, you know, showing their backs to the camera so they can be on, they can be on the directory. That&#8217;s a fantastic idea. I would love to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:03:48]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So, uh, for your, for your photos for this, did you take new custom photos for this event or did you select some out of your library? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:03:57]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> I, to be honest with you, I did select some out of my <span>[00:04:00]</span> library. So I&#8217;m in a very unique situation. I, I take a lot of photos for myself, which I do not share elsewhere. Like I used to, but then like, I just take photos as a, how do I say it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like for my own reference or just to read a memory. You know, I just keep going back to it. Yes. So I had a, I was, I&#8217;ve been sitting on a, um, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m sitting on a stash of at least 200, 000 photos. So I have, I have plenty of them. And it so happens that a lot of them meet our guidelines as well. So I just had to go back and 2023 was a year, 2022, 23.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I traveled a lot. And as you know, we&#8217;ve been together on at least a couple of those trips. So I, and I had a chance to take photos all over the world. So my photos reflect my travels. So you will, you will find photos from Kerala, Singapore, the U. S., Europe, right? Literally Japan, like you, you&#8217;ll see a side of the slice of the world in the nine photos that I contributed as part of the photo festival and my <span>[00:05:00]</span> other contributions in the past as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:02]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> I experienced that with Bigel as well after, uh, I think after WordCamp Asia. Yes. He went on a world tour. It would seem. Yes. He posted pictures from Serbia and Romania. And I&#8217;m like, yeah, don&#8217;t you live in India? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:20]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> Yeah. He, he, he is also sitting on a very similar, but actually much bigger stats than I. So I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:29]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. He recently passed me. The person with the most photos up there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:33]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> I did see that. I did see that. So interesting. , </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:37]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> he&#8217;s, he&#8217;s the man. . Yes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:39]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> So are you, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:40]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> okay, so no, there can only be one. It&#8217;s like, no, I, I, I </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:45]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> think that&#8217;s space for multiple. We have, we have no project so we, we can have as many people as, yes. So, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:51]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Um, so you were an attendee of this event, but what, practically <span>[00:06:00]</span> speaking, that sounds like you sat at your desk and uploaded nine photos. Uh, which is not a, not a lot of time commitment, which is kind of nice. Um, what does it, what does it mean to be an attendee of an event where you can spend, I mean, you can upload five pictures at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you did just five pictures, you could literally be an attendee and a contributor and take part in the whole event in five minutes. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:06:31]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> I, I still found it fulfilling and my, my regret is that I could not upload a lot more. I could have actually, I just got busy with other things, but I, but I did enjoy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a very unique experience and I think it reflects a future of events where we don&#8217;t need to be in person synchronously at a certain for a certain amount of time to do it. So there&#8217;s other ways where you can collaborate collectively, which like, like this event where you sort of like upload photos and <span>[00:07:00]</span> then it shows up in the photo directory and like you&#8217;ve made it available for anybody to really use that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m sure I can think of a, A hundred different scenarios that folks might find the photos that I&#8217;ve uploaded useful. So while it did, like you said, while it did take only five minutes for me, I didn&#8217;t feel the impact of it. You know, so, uh, I&#8217;ve not done this before and I feel, I felt part of the global WordPress community, which is why I keep contributing to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I uploaded those photos in those five minutes, You know, and when those were approved, when I got the email notifications that they were approved, it didn&#8217;t feel good. Um, it does feel good. I, I, yes, I, I felt connected to the global community. I felt this very unique sense of belonging. I felt so loved and like, it was like, I was a part of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, you know, uh, a global community. I already am. Yeah. But it felt even more so. So that was this warm, fuzzy feeling, which I got in five minutes, which I may not <span>[00:08:00]</span> have got at a, at another event. If I attended an online event or maybe even at an in person WordCamp, this feeling of, you know, having those photos out there in five minutes, it felt good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely felt good. Yeah. Yes. Yes. To the warm, fuzzy feeling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:08:14]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Similar, similar to being a code contributor, one line can change someone&#8217;s life. One photo can change someone&#8217;s project. Absolutely. If you get the perfect photo and it just fits. Yes. Um, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a really big deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:08:29]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> And, and it so happens that our photos are CC zero, which is the closest equivalent to GPL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he&#8217;s giving it out to the world. You&#8217;re, you&#8217;re just, you know, uh, maybe it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a blogger. They was looking for an image and this image fits for them or a company who was trying to, you know, create a corporate website. N number of uses and if it helps them that that that may that means the world for me So even if even if what one person uses a photo that i&#8217;ve used or maybe I mean it&#8217;s out there Even if others watch it that that that means the world to <span>[00:09:00]</span> me So I I didn&#8217;t have a few four people come into me and say hey those photos look good Which is a really good moment for me because I never consider myself to be a photographer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I told you, I just take photos for my own reference. I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;ll be honest with you. I&#8217;m not a photographer, but when, when random people, to be honest, it&#8217;s not a lot. It&#8217;s not like they said, Oh, this is a breathtaking photo, but they just. When, when somebody shares a positive comment on a work that you&#8217;ve done it, that&#8217;s what we live for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes. We&#8217;re all human beings and we need that validation. So that validation definitely felt good. So yes, yes, to the, yes, to everything is to belonging is to warm, fuzzy feelings is to being part of a global community. Yes. Helping others. So </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:40]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> you heard it here, kids comment on blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:43]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> People like it. Yes, absolutely. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:49]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. Um, so you did, you did nine photos. That was fulfilling. Was it fulfilling enough? If we do this again, are you, are you going to do more? Are you going to do less? <span>[00:10:00]</span> Are you happy with what you did? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:10:02]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> So, um, I was helping out with the, with the event and, um, I was obviously not looking for prices or anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was just doing this for me, of course. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s what, that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t do it, but when I&#8217;m doing it, when I&#8217;m doing it for a different photo festival. I might get into the competitive spirit. I&#8217;m going to, I might, I want to win prizes, but just kidding. I&#8217;m just doing it for open source. I would definitely do more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was definitely busier this time. So when the next event happens anywhere all over the world, I mean, that&#8217;s the beauty of this format, right? Anyone can organize it anywhere. It instantly, yes, it instantly becomes global. Which is, which is again the beauty of this format. So short answer to your question, yes, yes, and yes, I am, and I am going to be submitting way more photos than the nine ones that I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I have, I have, I have 200, 000 photos in my stash. So I need to, yeah, it would be a crime to not upload at least a hundred of them. So that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m going to try doing </p>\n\n\n\n<p>that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:10:58]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Are you going to wait for the event, or are you going to start <span>[00:11:00]</span> soon? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:00]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> I, so in fact, like, uh, I did see someone in, uh, I think it was Jonathan, Jonathan Doroshes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somebody did pledge in Twitter that saying, who was saying that, Hey, I&#8217;m going to, I&#8217;m going to contribute like a photo periodically on a periodic basis. Yeah. So I&#8217;ve been, I&#8217;ve been doing that idea myself. I want to do that actually like, I mean, of course I, I will be a part of an event, but other than that, I want to, I want to do this regularly, you know, because like, um, I, and again, that, that feeling of getting that email that your photo is approved and, you know, putting your work out there, I wouldn&#8217;t do this consistently on a regular basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, I am. I&#8217;m going to keep doing this. You will see more photos from me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:40]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> That&#8217;s very exciting. I look forward to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:41]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> Yes, yes. I know you&#8217;re a moderator, so I&#8217;m going to make your life a little difficult by giving you more photos to moderate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:49]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yep. Alright, well thank you very much for your time. This has been very enlightening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Topher. And I will talk to you later. Being an international event is one of the things that <span>[00:12:00]</span> makes this event unique. Next we&#8217;re going to talk to Nilo from Spain. Thanks for coming today. Uh, tell me your name and where you&#8217;re from. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:09]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> Hello. Thank you for having me here. I&#8217;m Nilo Velez and I&#8217;m from, from Sevilla, Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:15]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Oh, nice. Uh, I don&#8217;t know if you are closer to India in time than me or not. I don&#8217;t know what the offsets are. I </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:25]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> don&#8217;t know, because you&#8217;re maybe closer by one side. I&#8217;m closer on the other side. For me, it&#8217;s like seven hours. They are seven hours ahead from me. Something </p>\n\n\n\n<p>like </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:36]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> that. Oh, I think I&#8217;m 12. Yeah, so you&#8217;re closer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, uh, we&#8217;re here today to talk about the recent, uh, photos event that took place out of Kerala. Um, you&#8217;re in Spain. What made you think, Hey, look, an event in India. Let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s go do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:55]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> No, because I didn&#8217;t thought that it was an event in India. It was a <span>[00:13:00]</span> global event online. So from the photos, from the photos team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this time is in India, maybe next time is another place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:13:09]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s actually really good to know because. They tried to convey that it is, it is an international event for all the organizers are mostly from Kerala. Yes. And so </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:13:19]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> they are been talking about the idea, you know, about making it, uh, more times in another hosting cities around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:13:31]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. All right. Uh, and I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m sorry, you probably already said this. Where did you first see it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:13:39]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> I don&#8217;t know. I think it was the photo channel on Slack. Okay. Yeah, probably was there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:13:46]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Probably the first place they announced it. Um, so how many photos did you put in? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:13:54]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> I don&#8217;t remember. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a hundred something maybe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. No, no, no. No, <span>[00:14:00]</span> no, no. 80, 80 something. 83. Because the woman who won was 86. I was three photos, three photos behind her. Yeah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:14:13]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Okay. Um, that&#8217;s quite a lot. Uh, for those. Okay. Watching, listening, and unaware. You can only, only, only upload five at a time until they get moderated. And so you have to wait. And particularly during this event, the wait was really quite long most days because there were just so many to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, how did you manage to get so many through? Get up early in the morning or? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:14:42]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> No. Okay. Now that I, this is over, I can tell my secret. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:14:46]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:14:48]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> No. Uh, okay. Uh, actually it was a hack on, uh, you know, hacking in a good way. I consider myself, myself a hack, a hacker, uh, not by <span>[00:15:00]</span> the idea of the pirate that breaks things, but, uh, to find the loopholes, find the tricks behind things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, when the event was presented, uh, one of the moderators, uh, sold us. How the moderation, uh, QA works, right? I don&#8217;t remember if it was Michelle, maybe it was Michelle. Uh, and she said that, uh, when she moderate photos, uh, uh, you choose one of the photos from the QA and then, uh, the system automatically, uh, select another one random for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. So the trick is really easy is just to keep always five photos on the queue. Yes, because that way there&#8217;s more possibility of your photos get picked and moderated. Yep. And also they <span>[00:16:00]</span> say that the moderators have a problem because if the system flags an image, because it considers it violence, nudity, or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, the photo gets on hold, uh, because a super moderators have to, uh, go there and review that and remove the flag. And it was, uh, it happened a lot with animals. So no photos for animals. So if you, yes, send no photos for animals and keep five photos all the time, it&#8217;s more </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:34]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> problem probable that your photos </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:38]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> get approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:40]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a good plan. Um, in the early days, I used to always keep five in the queue, but that&#8217;s because there are only three of us moderating and you can&#8217;t moderate your own. Well, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:52]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> those are not the early days. The early days were when, uh, Rocio Valdivia, uh, tell us, okay, we are <span>[00:17:00]</span> doing something new, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>which is going to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A photo, something that they, they have sent me that they need photos. So you have been taking photos to WordCamp, so share, share that with us in this, uh, Google Drive album. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:17]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> That is a long time ago. Yeah. It&#8217;s been, it&#8217;s been years now, do you realize? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:22]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. I do now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:25]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Um, yeah. So. Uh, tell me about your photography, uh, do you have a, do you have a big camera or do you use a phone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:37]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> I use several cameras, uh, I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m a Sony shooter. I have been volunteering, volunteering as a photographer for a lot of work. Um, actually I work at my, uh, day job is as a developer and a translator. So this is more than a hobby, but you know, once you start going <span>[00:18:00]</span> to more and more work, you get a sponsor, you get a better year and you end up, uh, organizing the photography team or work on Europe, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:18:08]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> things happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:18:13]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> And there goes your impostor, your impostor syndrome, because you have, there&#8217;s one point in which you have to review the application for the volunteers, and you have to, to vet people who has been working as a professional photographer. For the press for 20 years or for the New York times, the National Geographic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you say, okay, I have to tell this guy how he has to take photos in a WordCamp. Okay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:18:39]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s funny. Uh, so you&#8217;ve been around WordPress for a while doing photo photography for a while. Um, I, I have a compliment for you. Um, another moderator was, we were talking about, um, I think kind of deal with <span>[00:19:00]</span> people submitting too many photos that were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Against the rules and someone said, Oh, but not, you know, he knows what he&#8217;s done. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:09]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> Yes, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:10]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> I actually take it a little personal when a photo of mine get rejected because, Oh, okay. That wasn&#8217;t, you cannot see the </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:19]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> face. You would have approved it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:25]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t know if I, if I, one time I&#8217;m on the other side, I don&#8217;t know what the decision would have taken in moments like that, but yes, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:34]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> it hurts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:37]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> I know what you mean. I gave up, uh, I don&#8217;t want to say caring. I gave up feeling the sting long ago. I have, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve a couple dozen rejected photos now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:52]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> No, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:52]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> but, uh, actually that, uh, has been, it&#8217;s much better now because, uh, on the early <span>[00:20:00]</span> days when a photo gets, gets, uh, got rejected, they only say, uh, that we don&#8217;t accept your photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the moderators leave a comment saying okay we cannot accept that photo because there&#8217;s a face showing on the top right or there&#8217;s a logo so you can crop the photo or edit or whatever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:22]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> That&#8217;s nice. Um, do you have any plans to do a photo event in New York City? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:31]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> I have already done now. Okay. A WordPress one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did, I did. Yeah. No, I, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:35]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> I did a, a WordPress photo walk during a WordPress meetup because I&#8217;m one of the organizer of the WordPress meetup group. Sure. And it went nice. We was like, uh, 10 foot photographers. I taught them how to contribute to the photo, the photo WordPress photo directory when taking photos and then they upload the song and it </p>\n\n\n\n<p>went great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:58]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> I was talking with <span>[00:21:00]</span> Bigel in another interview and he said one of the issues they had with photo walks is that everybody takes a picture of the same thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:21:08]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> because you tend to go in a group and oh hey a plant, hey a plant, everyone takes a photo of a </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:21:14]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> plant, yeah. Yes, a bird, look get it. No, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>but we, we did, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:21:19]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> uh, we did that on Seville on Christmas night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there was a lot of lights, a lot of different, uh, photos to take. And when, you know, we, there was always that photo that everyone, everyone took, but, uh, for most of it, it was, it was nice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:21:40]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> That&#8217;s really great. I think that&#8217;s all the questions I have for you. Um, really, I just wanted to know what you thought of being a participant in the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You liked it? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:21:51]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> I like </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:21:51]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> it very much. The only thing that, uh, maybe I missed, uh, I, I don&#8217;t say this as a critic, not, uh, <span>[00:22:00]</span> just as, uh, something that should be, uh, taken into account for the other edition, that, uh, as a participant, I missed a little more communication during the event, because it was the opening event, the opening ceremony, the closing ceremony, the closing ceremony.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that, uh, But during that, uh, you know, we try to get people into talk, um, uh, talking to the photos, uh, channel, but not so many people, uh, get involved, uh, on talk. So maybe, I don&#8217;t know, make, uh, some workshops or get, try to get people into the conversation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:22:39]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Right. That&#8217;s, uh, that&#8217;s an excellent point. Um, and I know people who were involved in the organizing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. I&#8217;ll definitely pass that on. Um, a lot of people said they, well, I guess when I was talking to the volunteers, they said they didn&#8217;t feel the need for more <span>[00:23:00]</span> communication. They were able to just do their thing and move on. But that&#8217;s maybe it&#8217;s different from as a volunteer. Participant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:23:11]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> Another thing that, uh, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s something that, you know, you, that you have your opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have mine, but the fact that the prices about, uh, participation, uh, with actually when you have a, such a huge bottleneck, because, uh, if you say, okay, I&#8217;m giving you a price. If you submit the most photos, actually you are making more pressure The moderator that actually volunteers. So like, okay, you are going to work a lot this, uh, the, maybe the prices will, should have been to the </p>\n\n\n\n<p>moderator who actually, but </p>\n\n\n\n<p>they, it was you that was working during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not me. I was </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:23:57]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> sick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:23:57]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Well, you are, you, it was, <span>[00:24:00]</span> it was, it was Michelle. Mostly Marcus was at a work camp. I was sick and Michelle. Moderated like 900 photos. That&#8217;s </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:24:10]</span> <strong>Nilo:</strong> just for you to share more on that </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:24:11]</span> <strong>Hari:</strong> word than me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:24:12]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s actually an excellent point. All right. Well, thank you for your time. I appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, maybe I&#8217;ll see you, uh, at work camp Europe this year. We&#8217;ll see. We&#8217;ll try. All right. Our final interview of the day comes from Chicago, Illinois. Yet another international attendee. Thanks for being here today. Uh, tell us your name and where you&#8217;re from. Sure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:24:44]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> Uh, Jeff Paul, director of open source at 10 up and I live in the Chicago area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:24:51]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. Um, there was a time when most of TENUP lived in the Portland area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:24:58]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> Unofficial <span>[00:25:00]</span> headquarters. Yeah, we still have a good size contingent there, but not fully, fully distributed, fully remote, fully growable. Uh, so yeah, spread out for sure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:25:10]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Nice. So we&#8217;re here today to talk about the, uh, international photos event that happened recently, and you are a participant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does that mean? What does that mean to you? I&#8217;ve heard a number of things about what it means to be a participant in this thing. What does it mean to you to be a participant in that event? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:25:28]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah, I mean, it was, uh, I saw it as an opportunity to finally do something with the, like, tens of thousands of pictures I&#8217;ve taken with my, uh, camera phone over the years, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, never really printing many out, uh, only occasionally sending some to folks, uh, Infrequently posting to my own blog. So yeah, it was like, Oh, I can actually, you know, one contribute, uh, to the project, which is cool in a new way for me. And then also like make use of hopefully some photos, <span>[00:26:00]</span> um, mostly accepted, uh, at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:05]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> That&#8217;s cool. Um, do you, you use a camera or </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:08]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> a phone? Primarily just a camera phone. So iPhone, whatever of the moment, uh, I think, I think my, the archive of things does include a camera, you know, back when. Yeah. The cameras on phones did not quite, uh, parallel the megapixels that you would get, but everything in like recent history is pretty much just the camera that&#8217;s, or the, the, sorry, the phone, um, yeah, not, not like a DSLR house over here by any means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:37]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> I don&#8217;t own a camera. I do it all on the phone. Uh, and if I did, I would struggle. Like I would take it on a photo walk, but most of my photos are very spontaneous and I&#8217;m not going to have my camera at a restaurant, walking down the street, whatever. And I think the vast majority of the photos on the project are camera phone.<span>[00:27:00]</span> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how did you hear about this event? What made you think? Hey, I&#8217;m going to go. Go do this thing. So </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:27:07]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> I, uh, I subscribe and follow the, uh, WordCamp Central, I think central. wordcamp. org, uh, just to be alerted when there&#8217;s new camps that come up, uh, usually to see if it&#8217;s one I want to try and attend. Uh, and this one came up as, uh, you know, it was unusual in that it wasn&#8217;t your typical WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s, you know, one of these kind of newer events that are being, uh, trialed now. And, uh, Seemed like an easy thing to contribute to. Um, the part participation part was a little more difficult &#8217;cause I think it was mainly hosted out of, um, India and the Indian time zone, and so I don&#8217;t have a great overlap there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so it was more of like a solo effort and not really as much of a community feel, <span>[00:28:00]</span> uh, on my end. But, uh, yeah, caught it from Word Camp Central. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:04]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Uh, I&#8217;m all right. It&#8217;s a good place. I&#8217;m finding that, uh, it was a very solitary event for most people. Um, Ari was on earlier and he said he picked five photos and sat down and uploaded them and he was done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the extent, I mean, he did, he did nine total. So he did that maybe twice, but, uh, just a few minutes in a, in a week long event to be a participant. But then he also pointed out that the results of those few minutes are going to last. Right. You know, those photos are right out there for anybody to use forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s kind of a cool, cool thing, a very simple way to be able to impact the project with a minimal effort. Yeah, probably one </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:56]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> of the easiest ways to contribute perhaps, uh, across <span>[00:29:00]</span> all the, the make teams for sure. I&#8217;m sure </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:02]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> it is. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that&#8217;s cool. I just, it still blows my mind. What a big thing it is for so little effort. Right. Right. Yeah. So, uh, how many photos did you upload? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:20]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> Um, I don&#8217;t have the immediate numbers, but I would say that I, so my first interaction with the photo directory was around WordCamp US last year. I published a couple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, I think I, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:36]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> I mean, just in this, uh, this event. Right. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:39]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> Point being, I think I had done a couple. You know, last fall didn&#8217;t really do any started in January being a bit more active, um, not probably more than like a dozen or two a month, but then I think during the span of the photo event. Uh, probably got, um, you know, I, I was, <span>[00:30:00]</span> you know, the, the cap is five at a time and pretty much as soon as one would get approved or rejected, um, you know, fairly quickly find another one and submit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, I don&#8217;t know exactly how many I submitted or the total that were accepted, but I, I&#8217;d probably say easily, uh, a dozen or so in that short timeframe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:30:21]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Um, I am impressed by anybody who got in more than 5 or 10 because the moderation queue was, it was very difficult to maintain. So well done. Um, I had another question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m trying to remember what it was. How many? Oh, would you do it again? Yeah, definitely. I mean, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:30:48]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> I think I. You know, I, I have a friendly, not even a wager, just a friendly competition with, uh, Jonathan DeRozers and, uh, I think Jeff <span>[00:31:00]</span> Galensky, uh, that came out of Twitter of just contributing as a group to the photo directory over the course of this year and just, you know, seeing how much the group of us can, can get published there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so I&#8217;ll. You know, continue to try and find ones to to submit. I think if there was another event would happily join in. I think the tagging aspect was a little clunky. So hopefully that can be improved. Um, and given that it was. You know, a community event for me, and it sounds like for others that you talk to it didn&#8217;t feel like there was a lot of a community feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So trying to find ways to give it more of that would be, I think, interesting and perhaps, you know, get keep folks more engaged. Um, you know, there was certainly, I think, a kickoff and a conclusion, uh, to the event, um, that was a synchronous call, but, uh, the time didn&#8217;t work for me, it was, I <span>[00:32:00]</span> think, super early on a Friday or Saturday or something, and I think, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:32:02]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> It was Saturday, I remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:32:04]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah, I was, yeah, I was five kids, so it was, it was difficult to make that happen. Um, And I think it was, I think it was fun that there was like, uh, awards for, you know, kind of like a, almost like an art show, right? Like best in show sort of thing. And there was monetary, uh, awards, uh, attached to that. Uh, uh, Aaron Jorban, who, you know, I collaborated with, um, as well in, in getting things submitted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, you know, he was, I think one of the honorable mentions or something, which was kind of cool for him. Um. I think if there were ways to, again, give it more of a community feel would be just a bit more interesting. Um, perhaps, um, like specific, um, side quests or achievements, right? Like a photo, you know, this sort of a photo or, um, you know, this kind of composition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right, exactly. Uh, best use of the color red. Who knows, right? Um, <span>[00:33:00]</span> uh, like those are things I think that could be interesting to. You know, give folks an idea of if they&#8217;re, if they&#8217;re going out to actively shoot with a camera or a camera phone to, you know, what to look for versus just like searching your back catalog of things to submit, um, could be fun and could give it a bit more of a community feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, the, the site they had up that pulled in, uh, kind of the tagged photos that were accepted was fun to. Browse through and see, but it didn&#8217;t feel like I was really interacting with anybody. Um, and that aspect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:33:29]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. Um, did this event feel special? Did it feel different from other times you&#8217;ve uploaded photos or were you just given incentive to do it a lot this one week?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:33:43]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> Uh, I think it was, it was interesting in that it was, you know, one of these next generation events that I think the community team is trying to, to spur forward. So I think it was fun to participate in that manner. Um, you <span>[00:34:00]</span> know, outside of that, um, you know, I don&#8217;t know that it was dramatically different than the contributions to the photo director I&#8217;ve done in the past, except for the fact that I kind of ratcheted up my attention to, um, keeping that cue of five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pictures topped off, right. So I could have things getting into the, the competition as it were. Um, other than, other than that, um, probably not a dramatic difference, uh, for me feeling wise again, because there, there wasn&#8217;t much of like a, a real community aspect of that contribution of, of, of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:34:37]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So basically I&#8217;m hearing that you&#8217;d like just more community involved or something more of a feeling of community during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:34:45]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> Yeah, something. I mean, or, or even, uh, you know, WordCamp U. S. last year, there was a physical. Uh, exhibit that had photos, I think from the photo directory printed out, um, and matted and framed in a nice little <span>[00:35:00]</span> photo installed down, uh, in the sponsor area. Um, so </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:35:04]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> They&#8217;re doing that again and WordCamp Asia, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:35:06]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you, I, you know, I could totally see where like, if, you know, this could be done again, perhaps, um, you know, the weeks leading up to a major WordCamp event, uh, and then. You know, maybe sponsored by one of the major sponsors and, um, you know, then the, the best and show the selected ones are actually then printed in, in, uh, shown in, in person at that WordCamp, I think would be really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, it gives you, again, it gives you a bit more of a, uh, community feel. Um, but, uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:35:46]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> those are great ideas. Um, tomorrow, my, uh, episode is going to be. About next gen events. Oh, cool. And all the <span>[00:36:00]</span> different ideas people have had for them. There&#8217;s some pretty exciting ones. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m really looking forward to the future of WordPress events. Yeah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:36:07]</span> <strong>Jeff:</strong> I mean, I think the. I&#8217;d love to see more of the kids camps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, especially ones that are attached to other events just because, uh, you know, if I&#8217;m already going, it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;d be great to bring my kid along and have them have something that&#8217;s tailored to their interests. Um, and then the, uh, the do actions I&#8217;ve never been able to participate in those. And so I, I, I would love, I would love to have, again, maybe attached to a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like a WordCamp, uh, Europe, Asia, U. S., um, you know, the ability to, you know, leverage the skills we have in contributing to the project and, and instead, you know, contribute to, you know, a worthy organization, right? I would love to see that as well. Um, and, and also really curious, what Uh, you know, perhaps all the other next gen ideas are like really excited to see, um, you know, the project branching out just beyond what I still love the camps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, you know, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re, <span>[00:37:00]</span> they&#8217;re fantastic. Um, but also really, always really interested and excited to see what else comes up there. So, uh, I&#8217;ll have to stay tuned. You got a, got a good hook for me on that one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:37:10]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. Well, yep. Check it out tomorrow. All right. That&#8217;s all I have for you today. Thank you for being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I appreciate your time. Good to see you Topher. And that concludes our episode for today. I&#8217;m glad you came. Thank you very much. It was really interesting hearing all the different experiences that people had, the variety of experiences. Some took just moments to be involved. Some took hours. And it was exciting to see how a different kind of event can happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, which brings me to my next point tomorrow, we&#8217;re going to be talking with Julia Golomb from the community team about next gen events and what they are, what they could be and how you can be involved.

If true, this could mirror an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/11/23791528/openai-shutterstock-images-partnership\">extended partnership that Shutterstock entered into with OpenAI</a> last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Claims of 404 Media&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>404 Media claims insider information about the deal–backed up with documentation–confirming Automattic is in the advanced stages of negotiation with these AI companies. To validate its claims <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/tumblr-and-wordpress-to-sell-users-data-to-train-ai-tools/\">404 Media quoted Tumblr Product Manager Cyle Gage</a> as he reported on an internal message board, the status of the initial data collection process and how it included content that should not have been collected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While 404 Media has provided quotes from an internal source, it has not provided any specific proof such as screenshots of conversations or access to source materials to assist others in validating their claims. 404 Media also refers to user content as “users’ data” which can easily be misconstrued as personally identifiable information (PII) or credit card information. Whereas the content being discussed in the article is content that is already publicly available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Response From Automattic&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Within a few hours of 404 Media’s article going up, Automattic released a statement describing its position on content distribution and the rights of all users on WordPress.com and Tumblr to opt out of their public content being included in data shared with AI partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic makes the argument that AI regulation and legislation do not yet exist and, as such, is taking these steps to proactively provide users with additional methods of controlling how and where their content is made available. They are creating a pathway for AI partners to get streamlined access to the content users are open to sharing while also taking steps to remove access to content that users no longer want to be shared. In other words, the content in question is already available to the AI companies as it’s publicly crawlable and content deals only make it more accessible and manageable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic published “<a href=\"https://automattic.com/2024/02/27/protecting-user-choice/\">Protecting User Choice</a>” emphasizing the following points:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>We currently block, by default, major AI platform crawlers—including ones from the biggest tech companies—and update our lists as new ones launch.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>We have a setting to discourage search engines from indexing a site on WordPress.com and Tumblr. This signals to search engines not to crawl that content or include it in search results.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>We have added similar settings to WordPress.com and Tumblr to discourage crawling by AI companies. If you already discourage search engine indexing, this is automatically enabled.</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>We will share only public content that’s hosted on WordPress.com and Tumblr from sites that haven’t opted out.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>We will share only public content that’s hosted on WordPress.com and Tumblr from sites that haven’t opted out.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://automattic.com/2024/02/27/protecting-user-choice/\">article</a> continues hinting at a deal in the future: “We are also working directly with select AI companies as long as their plans align with what our community cares about: attribution, opt-outs, and control. Our partnerships will respect all opt-out settings. We also plan to take that a step further and regularly update any partners about people who newly opt out and ask that their content be removed from past sources and future training.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic also released a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2024/02/27/more-control-over-the-content-you-share/\">new tool</a> that “lets you opt out of sharing content from your public blogs with third parties, including AI platforms that use such content for training models. We will engage with AI companies that we can have productive relationships with, and are working to give you an easy way to control access to your content…We already discourage AI crawlers from gathering content from WordPress.com and will continue to do so, save for those with which we partner… We are committed to making sure our partners respect those decisions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress.org Users Aren’t Affected</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Executive Director of WordPress shared this with the community in the Slack channel: “I can confirm that the WordPress project is not involved in selling user data or content for AI training purposes. This has been our consistent stance across the long history of WordPress, even as recently as when I was sharing<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/01/letter-from-wordpress-executive-director-2022/\"> thoughts for the future of our project heading into 2023</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, Jetpack <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jetpack/status/1762620580589920361\">tweeted</a> that “data from Jetpack connected sites is not included.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how your session cookies are being used to attack WordPress websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Thomas J Raef.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas is the founder of We Watch Your Website, a company that has been removing malware from websites since 2007. During that time, he&#8217;s seen many changes in the methods hackers use to take over our website, and that&#8217;s the focus of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With hackers becoming increasingly agile in their tactics, targeting everything from plugins to session cookies, Thomas brings to the table data he&#8217;s gathered from 2023, that puts the spotlight on the evolving digital threat landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explains how the system that he runs is able to gather a very large data set about WordPress websites in real time. Recording data directly from the server, he&#8217;s devised systems, which makes sense of this data. He&#8217;s able to turn back the clock and trace the stack of circumstances which led to a website being compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re all used to hearing that plugins themes, and sometimes the WordPress core, are the most likely culprits when something goes wrong. The story goes that out of date code, or a zero day is discovered and leveraged. Whilst Thomas does not doubt that this is true, he&#8217;s here to paint a somewhat different picture. A picture which puts the focus upon stolen session cookies as the most important factor in website attacks last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas explains what session cookies are, and why they unlock so much potential for a hacker. He tells us about the ways that session cookies are harvested, and the ways that you can mitigate the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been concerned about the security of your WordPress site, or intrigued by the intricacies of cyber security, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Thomas J. Rafe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Thomas Raef. Hello, Thomas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:29] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Hello, Nathan. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Good thank you. Firstly, dear listener, I have to extend my sincerest thanks to Thomas. For reasons that I won&#8217;t go into, Thomas and I have had to cancel a podcast appointment on multiple occasions, and by multiple, I really truly do mean multiple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just want to extend my thanks to Thomas for sticking with me. Coming back on many occasions only to find that a, I wasn&#8217;t there, or b, I wasn&#8217;t able to do the interview. So apologies for all that, Thomas, and thank you for staying the course. Really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:00] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Not a problem at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So Thomas is joining us today and we&#8217;re going to have a fairly in-depth conversation about security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know this is a topic that you&#8217;ve probably heard little bits and pieces about before, I think unless you&#8217;ve read the article that we&#8217;re going to delve into, I think it&#8217;s quite likely that you won&#8217;t have heard what Thomas has got to say. Now because we&#8217;re delving into security and security is a very technical thing and getting the right intuitions about security requires knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Thomas, it would be great if you could just paint a little bit of a picture. Give us your potted bio if you like, about who you are, what the company is that you founded and so on. Just so that we have some inclination that you know what it is that you are talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:44] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Okay, sure. Yeah. I started, I&#8217;ve been in the IT industry since, as I tell people, IBM has one month more experience in the PC market than I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They started, originally released the IBM PC in September of 81. And, I started working with PCs in October of 81. So in 2007, 2006, I&#8217;m sorry, I was working more toward security. More and more people were getting hacked. This was well after the I Love You virus and all the, popular ones. And I was just really inquisitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So got started in 2007 with the company that I founded, We Watch Your Website. Nobody ever asked me what does your company do? But, I started that company, it was to address the need for malware remediation on websites. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People ask about, oh, my computer&#8217;s infected. Can you help me? I can, but it&#8217;s not, that&#8217;s not what we do. So at any rate, we started that. I started We Watch Your Website. Belonged to a website called Badware Busters, which was started by Max Weinstein, who I believe now is with Sophos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s a Harvard grad. Google would send people to badwarebusters.org with their infected websites, get help for free. Daniel Sid, who founded Sucuri. And so I learned a lot, and started applying that to helping people with infected websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got a call from Bluehost one day, helped out, Matt Heaton, the founder with his personal website, and they&#8217;re like, hey, how would you like if we sent you some business? And I was like, oh, okay. And for the longest time I was their default to go to for infected websites, so that I learned a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had to automate a lot because they were sending me so many sites, so much business. So I had to automate our procedures a lot, but people also wanted to know how their sites were infected. So it got me down the avenue of reading, log files, and how could I record things and, infections in the database and so on, so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve been doing this now since 2007. As of now, the day of this recording, we are now watching over 12 and a half million websites. Gives us a lot of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, a very large amount of data. We&#8217;ll get into that. So first of all, dear listener, I think it&#8217;s probably a good idea if you are listening to this, to perhaps pause the recording and go and read an article, which is on the We Watch Your Website blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, had we been able to record this podcast episode at the first opportunity. We probably wouldn&#8217;t have been so far away in time because this article was written on the 3rd of January, 2024. So it&#8217;s not the newest one, but the information, I presume is still up to date and you are sticking by the conclusions that you made there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the article is called The Real Attack Vector Responsible for 60% of Hacked WordPress Sites. And we&#8217;ll get into what that 60% is, and potentially how it differs from what most people, I would imagine think is the cause of problems on WordPress websites throughout the world. But first of all, wanted to dive into the sort of technical details of how it is that your system works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned that you&#8217;ve automated a lot of things. You mentioned that there are gigantic amounts of log files being created all the time. But I wonder if you would tell us how your system differs from what typically most WordPress users will do, which is install some plugin. Your service is not that. So tell us what it is that you do, and how it differs from what a plugin can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:34] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Yeah. One of the problems with the security plugins, not all, is that it only operates at the application layer. So it can only see things, its way. On a VPS or a dedicated server or a cloud server like Digital Ocean, Vultr, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can actually install some agents on there that give us information at the network layer. Like for instance, one of the problems with a lot of security plugins that we&#8217;ve seen is they&#8217;ll see an attack from an IP address, but that IP address has been spoofed by the hackers because of the way the security plugin was written.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So our information is the raw IP address, like we&#8217;re seeing it at the network level of the server. Doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s WordPress or anything else, we&#8217;re seeing the raw IP address. So that gives us an advantage there. So, the information that we collect, on a live basis on a server based account is we grab the access logs live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re also monitoring the database for changes live. We&#8217;re monitoring the files, they call it the file integrity monitoring is the term that they, they like to use. So we&#8217;re watching for any file changes on your website. And then we&#8217;re also watching the processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The processes run in memory on your server. There&#8217;s certain elements in the processes that can tip us off to an infection, or an attack. And for all these logs, like I said we&#8217;re, right now we&#8217;re monitoring 12 and a half million websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have seven clusters that collect this data, and each of these clusters can collect 20 million log entries per second. And then it correlates all this information. So you log into a WordPress site, there&#8217;s an entry in the database, it only stays in there until you log out. Now if you don&#8217;t log out the information stays in there, but we want to capture it as it happens. So that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re monitoring the database live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, you log into a WordPress site, there&#8217;s activity in the access log, where you came from, your user agent, things like that. You know what point you went to. Changes in the database. So we capture that as well. And our system has been designed to be smart enough so it knows a failed attempt versus, a session cookie. If you just close your browser and then you open it back up again and you&#8217;re still logged in, that&#8217;s because your session cookie is still active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can tell that type of login versus you&#8217;re logging in with a username and password. We can see attacks, sometimes we see attacks before they&#8217;ve been announced. Other times, we&#8217;re just seeing them like everybody else is. So that&#8217;s the information that we&#8217;re gathering, and how we&#8217;re gathering it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m imagining a WordPress website. This may be a terrible analogy, but I&#8217;m imagining a WordPress website, a bit like a layered cake. And the front end of the website, I&#8217;m imagining is the icing on the top. So that&#8217;s the very top, and you can go down, and you get into the plugin space and you get into the admin space, and eventually you get into the sort of base layers of the cake. And at this point we&#8217;re onto the hardware and the software that the WordPress site is running on. So we&#8217;re thinking about the operating system that your host is using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And from what you&#8217;ve said, and forgive me if I get this technically wrong, but it sounds like your system is able to access the lower down levels of that cake, the base layer if you like. Things approaching root access to the OS, things like that. So from that, it sounds like you can gather a different set of data than a plugin may be able to, and I guess your contention would be that because you are able to gather that different set of data, and it probably doesn&#8217;t have the capacity to be modified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve gathered that data in real time, you can then spend time looking back at that data in the days, weeks, months after. Patterns may have been discovered. You discover patterns and you can figure out what&#8217;s happened. So does that layer description work fairly well, with WordPress at the top, and the OS, the computer that it&#8217;s running on at the bottom, and you are injecting yourself as close to the bottom as you can?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:07] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Yes. Perfect analogy. You summed it up nicely. Yeah, we&#8217;re working at the, at a range, and typically at a root level, where the username that&#8217;s running the WordPress site doesn&#8217;t have access to the stuff, as you described, at the lower layers that can&#8217;t get, that user doesn&#8217;t have access, doesn&#8217;t have permissions, authentication, to access the stuff at the lower levels of the cake. And that&#8217;s where we operate. We can&#8217;t be tampered with unless you have root access, and hacker has root access that&#8217;s game over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So that&#8217;s the first thing to notice. You are able to gather a different type of data than a plugin would do, simply because the plugin cannot typically, there may be scenarios where it can, I don&#8217;t know, but typically it can&#8217;t get outside of WordPress, so it can&#8217;t necessarily get to the operating system which is running WordPress. That might be Linux or whatever it is, but your system can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;m presuming that if you want to use your service. It&#8217;s not a WordPress plugin. You are in some way getting access to the server. If I was to sign up as a client of yours, what would that process look like? Do you ask for SSH details from me and things like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:28] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Yeah, basically. We typically provide our public key for SSH and you can install it, we can install it. And then that gives us the access, the accessibility that we need to implement our system onto your server. We watch all the sites on that server. It is just something with me from years and years ago, I couldn&#8217;t see why if I have access to all of your sites, why I should charge you per site. It never made sense, and that&#8217;s just me. I&#8217;m not saying my way is right. That&#8217;s just me. Yeah, we cover every site on that server and it&#8217;s just easier that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are collecting data at this root level, in many cases I would imagine, in real time. And you said that could run on seven clusters of servers that you yourself have got. So it&#8217;s everything that&#8217;s happening on the server is reporting things in real time to you. And I think you mentioned the slightly jaw dropping number of 20 million. Log files could be written per second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounds to me like a fairly unmanageable amount of data to look at. I&#8217;m imagining a spreadsheet with an additional 20 million rows added per second. And, I&#8217;m quickly realizing that no human can actually take any meaningful glance at that and get any data out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you talked about automation. Do you just want to get into that a little bit? What are you doing there? Because my immediate intuition here is that you are looking backwards in time to find problems that have occurred. So maybe somebody&#8217;s come to you and, something quirky is going on with my website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please, can you look back and see if there&#8217;s something that has happened? So is that what you are doing? Are you looking back in time to spot patterns? Or are you also looking for things happening in real time to prevent known let&#8217;s call it attacks for now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:19] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Both. For the report that we&#8217;re talking about today, obviously we went back in time. So we have a huge ScyllaDB database, that&#8217;s pretty much spread around the world. And so all this information is gathered and put into that database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then from there we can run our queries for these reports. Yeah, we can look back in time. But also, in real time, our system is watching for these patterns. Yes, in creating this report we did spot a number of new patterns along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You dig in further there into your data, because you have all the data, and you can see that these patterns had started a year ago or so. And were repeating with different sites around the world. So, to answer your question, yeah, we do analyze things in real time, so we can see when a hacker or someone from a Digital Ocean server, let&#8217;s say. I don&#8217;t want to pick on Digital Ocean, but let&#8217;s say one of their servers was logging into your WordPress site. Now there&#8217;s a obviously a couple things that could be happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somebody could be using like a management console, like a MainWP, ManageWP, some of those, WP Umbrella. Some of those types of management systems. And that&#8217;s something you install on your own server and then it connects to your website. But, we know about those. Typically a server, or let&#8217;s say a GoDaddy server. Why would a GoDaddy server want to be logging into your WordPress site over and over again? And it has an outdated user agent. There&#8217;s a couple of red flags there. Those types of things we block, we filter in real time and block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so you&#8217;re spotting patterns for things that have happened and you are doing that after the fact. But you&#8217;re also gaining, I guess useful information from those patterns to create rules which can prevent things from happening. Because you can see this pattern is recurring. Okay, it&#8217;s now cropping up over here. Let&#8217;s block that traffic, because we know that is very likely to be malicious. The user agent is five years out of date, and it&#8217;s coming from a server that has no business logging in at all. It&#8217;s not an end user. There&#8217;s something quite strange here. And so in that way, you are preventing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. I think we&#8217;ve got a vague handle on what it is that you gather, and why you gather it, and how you gather it. Obviously, if you want to reach out to Tom and talk about this, you can do, I&#8217;m sure by the end of the podcast we&#8217;ll have dropped an email or a contact form or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m going to link back now to the article. Once again, it&#8217;ll be linked in the show notes, and I&#8217;ll give you the title again. The Real Attack Vector Responsible for 60% of Hacked WordPress Sites in the Year 2023. So we&#8217;re looking back at the previous year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I think that if I was to ask more or less, let&#8217;s say I had a thousand WordPress users in a room, and I was to ask them, what is responsible for the majority of problems with WordPress websites in terms of let&#8217;s say being hacked. I know that you didn&#8217;t want to use that word, but let&#8217;s just use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the intuition would be, it&#8217;ll be problems with themes, plugins and possibly, but not very often, Core. But plugins and themes. I think most people&#8217;s intuitions will be out of date or vulnerable, zero day problems with plugins from and themes. And you are saying no to that. You&#8217;re not saying that doesn&#8217;t exist, but what you are saying is that there is a much bigger attack surface, which I genuinely didn&#8217;t even know about until I read this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;ve got three types of attacks. Let&#8217;s just list those out quickly. We&#8217;ve got the first one is compromise username and password credentials. I don&#8217;t think we need to go into that too much. Obviously if you&#8217;re distributing your username and password everywhere, or it&#8217;s been part of the LastPass breach, we know that anybody can log in as you right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins and themes. We&#8217;ve just touched on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you are saying that there&#8217;s this other thing, stolen session cookies, and your contention is that the majority, not just a small slice of the cake, the majority of problems, compromise problems with WordPress websites is to do with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, can we lay out the groundwork? What is a session cookie and how can it be stolen, and how impactful can the stealing of a session cookie be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:01] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> A session cookie is required with http, https. It maintains your session basically, so that, if you&#8217;re on, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re on an e-comm website, and you add some stuff to your shopping cart, and then you browse around the site, and then you come back to your shopping cart. And you say, oh, okay, yeah, I&#8217;m going to, order this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The session cookie is required so that it knows you from somebody else visiting the site at the exact same time, putting stuff in their cart. It keeps your session separate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of WordPress and our research in particular, a session cookie keeps you logged in, or shows WordPress that you are logged in with valid credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you go to your WordPress website, log into WP admin, enter your username and password. Hopefully it&#8217;s using some form of 2FA or MFA, to help you be more secure. But now you&#8217;re in, and as you&#8217;re bouncing around different pages, WordPress needs to know that, okay, yes, you are authenticated to go to this page and to do this activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s all, that&#8217;s what the session cookie does. It&#8217;s a little piece of code on your local computer, on your local device, that your browser saves that tells the website that yes, you are authenticated to do these activities as an administrator on that WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I just pause you there and can we just delve into that a little bit more deeply? Because I, I know that there&#8217;s going to be a bunch of people listening to this who are very technically proficient and they&#8217;ll probably be thinking, Nathan, this is all very straightforward. But equally, I think there&#8217;ll be a bunch of people who, what you just described is not entirely obvious. So let&#8217;s just drill down on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I go to wptavern.com and I go to the login page and I enter my username and password and 2FA or what have you, and I&#8217;m now logged in. The WordPress website has then provided something to my browser. It is unique for that session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I then go to another page or leave the browser window open and come back, let&#8217;s say in 24 hours, when I am browsing around, every time I try to do something new, go to a new page, add a new post, or what have you, that cookie is being requested and there&#8217;s a check going on to say, is this person allowed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we have authentication to say that this person in the recent past logged in and we know them. And that&#8217;s happening all the time, right? Until we log out. And if we log out, that cookie is expunged, it&#8217;s deleted. And that&#8217;s the reason that if we go to, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m in Chrome and I&#8217;m logged in successfully to WordPress, and then I open up Firefox and try to use my WordPress website, it won&#8217;t allow it. Because that cookie has not been lodged in the browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I was to open up a private or incognito window, the same thing. It&#8217;s a different silo. I can&#8217;t interact until I&#8217;ve logged in again. So this cookie, if you like, is the gatekeeper for my access until I log out. So the possession of that exact cookie proves who I am, and it&#8217;s the only thing, it&#8217;s the only thing which entitles me to use the website. So if I can somehow get hold of that cookie, and it&#8217;s not my cookie, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m logged into your website. If I can get hold of Thomas&#8217;s cookie for his WordPress website, I can impersonate you a hundred percent you. No caveats, no ifs, no buts. I am you. Have I got that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:43] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Yep, exactly. It is the key to the kingdom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So if that could be taken from me, all bets are off. As far as any machine in the world is concerned, any computer that I&#8217;m using at that moment, if I can get that cookie, I can be you. In the case of a WordPress website, I can then delete every piece of content that has ever been written on that website. I can deface the website in any way I see fit. If I happen to steal the session cookie for your Amazon website, obviously I have the credentials to go and use your credit cards and buy and, whatever it is that I wish. So this cookie really is, it is the gatekeeper for everything, and you are saying it&#8217;s being stolen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:27] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Yes, big time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s not trivial. It sounds like, stolen session cookie, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a stolen session cookie. It sounds benign, but it really is unlocking complete access to whatever it is that user in WordPress is entitled to do. And obviously if it&#8217;s an administrator role, that&#8217;s a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so the next thing I have to ask is, how on earth do I get your cookie? How is it possible that cookies can escape the confines of my browser? How can that be achieved?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:56] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> There&#8217;s a number of ways, and big thing if you really want to go down the rabbit hole, as Oliver from Patchstack likes to call things, you can Google the term info stealer, and you can see how big a market that is in the underground. Info stealers bypass antivirus programs, they bypass almost everything and they have access to your computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say, in our scenario here, you log into a WordPress site, you don&#8217;t log out, you just close the browser window, or you leave it open, whatever. You go to another website, your computer gets infected with an info stealer, first thing it, it does is grab all the information at can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s grabbing your bank information. Information about your computer, your browser, all sorts of information. But it&#8217;s also grabbing session cookies because those are, they&#8217;re easy to use. And, as you said the gatekeeper to so many things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it records all that information, and the info stealers start to use it in whatever way they can. And I was just reading a report yesterday where they said that within 10 seconds after an info stealer has infected somebody&#8217;s computer, it steals all the information that it needs, then it&#8217;s gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it could delete itself so there&#8217;s no trace. So you, don&#8217;t think, oh geez, my antivirus just found this info stealer on my computer after I ran a full system scan. I should contact my bank. No, they don&#8217;t want you to think about all that. They want to be able to sell your information or use it themselves. So, 10 seconds, bam, they&#8217;re gone. They&#8217;ve taken everything they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> This then is an attack which is perpetrated typically onto the computer that you are using. So I&#8217;m sitting in front of my Mac, could be Windows, could be Linux. So it&#8217;s a vulnerability that somebody has discovered in the OS that I&#8217;m using. So Mac, Linux, Windows, what have you. We know how this works. There&#8217;s so many routes into this, but one might be that you accidentally click on a malicious link in an email and it takes you somewhere and you may be on a website, which looks like a legitimate website, but is actually downloading a payload and opening it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t need to get into that, but have I got that right? This is something which is installed on your local computer. One of its primary things will be to consume bank details and all that, but also to just what browsers are there. Can we please have all the session cookies? We extract those, remove the offending software, and it&#8217;s like nothing ever happened. Again, have I parsed that about right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:33] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Yep, perfectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So I guess all the caveats around not clicking links in emails and keeping your operating system up to date, and the general hygiene of being a custodian of a computer. But you are saying though, that it will go into the browser, suck out all of the cookies, and from that moment on, if I, and we&#8217;ll just stick to WordPress from now on, if I haven&#8217;t logged out of my WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And obviously if I&#8217;m a manager of a hundred WordPress websites, oh boy, then you could have a hundred WordPress website cookies in there. How long do I have for the attacker to go and do their dastardly work? I know that if I leave my WordPress website and I don&#8217;t click logout, at some point it logs me out. But I don&#8217;t entirely know what that length of time is. I have this intuition. It&#8217;s two days or 14 days or something. like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:29] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> You&#8217;re right on,both accounts. It typically, it&#8217;s 48 hours, from the time you logged in. But, if you click on the remember me, on your login page for a WordPress, the session cookie stays live for up to two weeks. Now, that&#8217;s only if you do not log out. If you log out, it instantly expires the session cookie. So it won&#8217;t matter if your session cookie&#8217;s stolen or not. It&#8217;s expired, so it can&#8217;t be reused, but so it&#8217;s 48 hours or two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that&#8217;s interesting. The one utterly mitigating factor here is that if you simply log out of any of these services, the WordPress website we&#8217;ll use again as the example. If I was to simply log out each time that I&#8217;d finished working, that cookie, even if it was stolen, it&#8217;s of no use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They would be asked to log in again. So, okay, but, if I&#8217;ve clicked remember me, the attackers who stole the, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m on the, website today. I log in today, I click remember me, and moments after I do that, by coincidence my computer is, all of that data is exfiltrated away from it. They&#8217;ve got 14 days to impersonate me, and presumably there&#8217;s the capacity for them to continue to pretend to be me beyond 14 days. Do they have the capacity to extend that 14 day window by, oh, I don&#8217;t know, going to a particular page which authenticates me again or something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:01] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> No, originally that was my impression was that they could extend that time period. My friend Calvin quickly corrected me on that, on that little bit. So no, you can by going into the database. Once you have admin rights, you could go into the database and change things in the, in the database table, the user meta, and extend the life of the cookie. But, no. There isn&#8217;t any way that you can extend that. I recently, I corrected that in the article. You have up to two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So how do you spot that this is happening?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:33] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Obviously if you&#8217;re, If you&#8217;re logging in with username and password, you have to go to WP admin or WP login, and log in. With a stolen session cookie you don&#8217;t need to do that. The session cookie is active, non expired, however you want to call it. I could just go and access a URL of plugin install dot PHP, and give it the parameters that follow that, and it&#8217;ll install that plugin. I don&#8217;t have to authenticate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the thing about session cookies that I also want to mention right now is, session cookies are valuable because they bypass 2FA, because you&#8217;re already authenticated. It bypasses 2FA, MFA, everything. You&#8217;re in. So yeah, I could install a bogus plugin. I can install a bogus theme. Anything you can do in a query string, basically as an admin, you can do with a stolen session cookie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So in the logs that you are seeing then, is the way to see this that suddenly some entity on the internet just crops up and successfully requests a page that they shouldn&#8217;t have been able to access. So in this case, you were talking about installing a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The typical route to that would be to log in, but you don&#8217;t see any activity from that IP address, and what have you, going through the login process, and because that&#8217;s missing, you are then inferring from that, hang on. How can they have missed the login step? They must have used a stolen cookie in order to achieve this. Is that about right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:18] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Yeah. And being able to go back in time, as we mentioned before, gives us a lot of power because we can see, was there a login from this IP address? Now some people will say, IP addresses can change in the middle of a session, blah, blah, blah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, but the way our system works is you&#8217;re not going to see a login, from Canada and then four hours, 4, 5, 6 hours late, whatever, have a login from Hong Kong. It&#8217;s virtually impossible. So what our system does is, it goes back and says, okay, when was the last valid login?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People say, you can&#8217;t tell that from a, from an access log. Again, access logs are not the only thing that we monitor. We also monitor the database so we can see who logged in, from where, with what user agent, so on, so forth. All that is recorded and kept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can say, okay, John logged in from Canada on Monday, and we see that he used the username and login, and bam. So he logged in and now, a day later, somebody from wherever, Hong Kong, or from a server suddenly just went right to the WP admin slash plugin dash install dot PHP, with a long query string, telling it what plugin to install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus you see in the database another access happening. So there&#8217;s a combination of things going on that when all correlated, paints a perfect picture of. Okay, this person, the person from Hong Kong, accessed with the session cookie, probably taken from John in Canada when he logged in the other day because it&#8217;s the same username, but now he&#8217;s in Hong Kong and they just installed a bogus plugin. So, it doesn&#8217;t take a rocket scientist to put all this together and say, yeah, okay, unequivocally, that was a stolen session cookie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So if you go to the article, again, it&#8217;ll be linked in the show notes. You can see there are some log entries written out, or there&#8217;s a screenshot taken of this exact process. So you can see what&#8217;s going on, and what I&#8217;m inferring from this is if you were to just look at a handful of logs, just two or three log entries, pretty much everything would look benign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any single log entry is going to appear broadly legitimate. Obviously if you&#8217;ve got a Chrome user agent dating back to, 2006, there&#8217;s probably something weird going on there. But broadly speaking, any one of those logs in isolation could be legitimate. It&#8217;s the picture that you are building up over time. You know the we had somebody in Canada. Now we have somebody in Hong Kong. They&#8217;re coming, they&#8217;re doing things, which it looks like they ought to have had to log in order to do. And you&#8217;re just building up this tapestry, this mosaic of different things and inferring, different things from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so I think we&#8217;ve got a handle with that. Now we&#8217;re going to go towards the sort of middle of the article, and this is probably where we&#8217;ll round off this conversation because, you&#8217;ve summarized the findings from 2023 and you&#8217;ve got a couple of charts. One is a pie chart, which spells things out really easily. And this pie chart is called yearly distribution of hack root causes in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, my intuition would&#8217;ve been plugins, themes, core, would&#8217;ve been the big slice of that pie. And your data is telling you that makes almost 33%. So it&#8217;s almost exactly a third, and I would&#8217;ve expected that to be significantly bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compromised logins, so stolen through stealing the computer or just getting into a LastPass vault, or just asking somebody what their user name and password was, 7.2%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that leaves us with a remaining almost exactly 60%, almost two thirds is this stolen session cookie. So the takeaway that you&#8217;ve got is the vast majority of infections, hacks, whatever we want to call it, is coming via this mechanism. That&#8217;s fairly surprising. Was that something you expected to see?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:39] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Not at all. I fully expected to see more of the core, plugin, theme vulnerabilities. This was originally intended to, a, to see exactly where the numbers fall. But also I wanted to, with no request, but I wanted to share this information with Oliver from Patchstack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s got some valid data, a large amount of data, to show that this is how hackers are hacking is through vulnerable plugins and themes. But, yeah, it didn&#8217;t turn out that way at all. I was shocked, and I ran through the numbers so many times. I had to delay this report so many times because I was just like, no, this can&#8217;t be</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, because it&#8217;s not the intuition that we have, it&#8217;s not the received wisdom. It&#8217;s not what we see being talked about online in blog posts and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting addendum to that pie chart though, is another chart which sits beneath it, and it&#8217;s more akin to a bar chart. But what it shows is that, if you were to take this month by month. So it takes that entire year and it divides it up into month by month, and you can see the data. And it does show that in certain periods of the year 2023, that intuition of it&#8217;s going to be plugins, themes, and core. That was in fact the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For certain periods of time, plugins, themes, core was the dominant problem. And for example, your data is pointing that in April, 2023, plugins, themes, core was the major problem. And can you correlate that to some sort of zero day, or some widely used plugin, or some core update. Are you able to match that against a widely known problem with an external third party piece of software like a plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:26] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> plugin? Yes, right around that time is when the essential add-ons for Elementor was hit. That was huge. That particular point in time was right when essential add-ons for Elementor had a zero day, and hackers went crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so what we&#8217;re learning from that is, or maybe I&#8217;ve got my intuitions wrong, but also I should say that the same sort of thing seems to have happened in July, and we could get into what was the problem there. But it seems that from your data, the hackers are agile in their approach to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in other words, if their primary vector during the year 2023 was stealing session cookies and there&#8217;s no major problems, no zero day exploits amongst WordPress plugins and themes. They&#8217;ll concentrate on the session cookie, because if there&#8217;s no big problems with plugins and themes, this is going to be our best vector of attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they&#8217;ll drop that, and go to the plugin, theme attack at the moment where that looks like it&#8217;s going to offer the best, I really don&#8217;t mean to say the word best, but for them at least, it&#8217;s going to be more useful for them to flip over to attacking that particular zero day in a plugin or a theme or whatever it may be. And so they switch. So they&#8217;re not stupid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:42] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> They&#8217;re not. I tell people this all the time. I hate to give hackers credit, but they&#8217;re some of the smartest people in the world. I&#8217;ve said for years that if hackers ever focused on a cure for cancer, there&#8217;d be no cancer. These people are smart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people who write the code, there&#8217;s various levels of hackers and, they&#8217;re not all super smart, but the ones who write the code, they&#8217;re extremely smart and yeah, and agile. As you can see. Like I said, I&#8217;ve had other people ask me why do you think that they shifted so much to stolen session cookies? Because just Google info stealers, and you&#8217;ll see just a plethora of information. Entire company&#8217;s dedicated to tracking info stealers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a company in Israel that buys old computers from people, and they dissect these computers and find out that, how many info stealers are on these computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a huge market. Some people say, oh no, it&#8217;s, that rarely happens. No, it happens a lot. And it&#8217;s not just my information, it&#8217;s information from many other security companies on how prevalent this is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me it lends credence to how effective something like a Patchstack is at preventing Infections through plugins and themes and core because, that&#8217;s what they do. That&#8217;s what they focus on. So to me hackers saw the writing on the wall. Okay more and more people are implementing processes and procedures to prevent us from hacking their core themes and, plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have to shift our focus here, and okay, we got all these info stealers that are running rampant. We&#8217;ll just have them steal session cookies too. Because, when you think about the whole spectrum of computer security. How are most attacks carried out? Oh, through an infected website. Well, how do you get those? Oh, let&#8217;s steal session cookies. One just feeds on the other. So it&#8217;s a logical progression for hackers, and they need them for phishing, infected websites for majority of their attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steal session cookies. We don&#8217;t have to worry about 2FA. Seems like the whole world is starting to shift towards 2FA. Stolen session cookies bypasses 2FA. We get access to website. It&#8217;s like a perfect scenario for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we&#8217;re used to the mantra of update plugins, update themes, keep WordPress core up to date. And nowadays inside a reasonably up-to-date WordPress website, there&#8217;s the option to automate all of that. And there are, you mentioned things like MainWP and ManageWP and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are these services which will assist you in that. But now we have this new problem of session cookies. Are there any bits of advice that you could give for remediating this problem? We touched on logging out as a really credible way of doing it, but is there anything else that you would advise a typical user of WordPress that they can do to, mitigate this? Because it does sound as if, if your session cookie is stolen, you really are putting your feet to the fire a little bit. So what can we do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:47] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Other than logging out, you have two good options. The first one is Fortress by Calvin. He controls, the whole Fortress, is a, like a login system, if you will. That&#8217;s putting it lightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, it controls session cookies in a way that keeps them very short term, and forces auto log out and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option is SolidWP. Nice thing about SolidWP is they tie the IP address into the session cookie. So guess what? Somebody steals your session cookie, they&#8217;re going to go use it from Hong Kong, they can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a separate, it&#8217;s a different IP address. Case closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So there go. Three bits of advice. You&#8217;ve got a couple of services that you can use there, but also just log out. It&#8217;s a fairly surprising set of results that you came up with in 2023, and I guess on some level it is also, it&#8217;s kind of misery making in a way, isn&#8217;t it? Because it just demonstrates that the hackers are serious about this and they&#8217;re credible at what they do. And I guess it&#8217;s a process of just listening to advice from people like you and trying to stay one step ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess you&#8217;ll be doing this again in 2024, and we&#8217;ll see if the, ground has moved. Let&#8217;s hope it has, and that slice of the pie that 66% has in some way gone down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas, if somebody wants to reach out to you and have a chat about this, talk about what it is that you do and what have you, where are the best places that they can find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:22] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> They can email me. It&#8217;s traef, traef@wewatchyourwebsite.com. They can find me on Skype, We Watch Your Website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m on Facebook, as Thomas J Raef. You can ping me on Messenger. Like I said, I&#8217;m active in a lot of the Facebook WordPress groups, the admin bar, places like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty easy to find. I always like talking. Ping me, look me up. Get a hold of me. We&#8217;ll talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. Well, the ones that you mentioned, I will make sure to put into the show notes, but thank you so much for giving us that interesting information from the data that you gathered over the year 2023. Really fascinating. And Thomas, I appreciate you coming on the podcast and chatting to me today. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:08] <strong>Thomas J. Raef:</strong> Thank you, Nathan. It&#8217;s always a pleasure chatting with you. Be well my friend.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Thomas J. Raef.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas is the founder of We Watch Your Website, a company that has been removing malware from websites since 2007. During that time he’s seen many changes in the methods hackers use to take over a website, and that’s the focus of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With hackers becoming increasingly agile in their tactics, targeting everything from plugins to session cookies, Thomas brings to the table data he’s gathered from 2023 that puts the spotlight on the evolving digital threat landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explains how the system that he runs is able to gather a very large dataset about WordPress websites in real time. Recording data directly from the server, he’s devised systems which make sense of this data. He’s able to turn back the clock, and trace the stack of circumstances which lead to a website being compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re all used to hearing that plugins, themes, and sometimes WordPress Core, are the most likely culprits when something goes wrong. The story goes that out of date code, or a zero day is discovered and leveraged. Whilst Thomas does not doubt that this is true, he’s here to paint a somewhat different picture. A picture which puts the focus upon stolen session cookies as the most important factor in website attacks last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas explains what session cookies are, and why they unlock so much potential for a hacker. He tells us about the ways that session cookies are harvested, and ways that you can mitigate the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been concerned about the security of your WordPress site or intrigued by the intricacies of cybersecurity, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wewatchyourwebsite.com/\">We Watch Your Website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cybersecurity-history-iloveyou/45001/\">ILOVEYOU worm</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/newsroom/BadwareBusters\">Badware Busters</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wewatchyourwebsite.com/the-real-attack-vector-responsible-for-60-of-hacked-wordpress-sites-in-2023/\">The Real Attack Vector Responsible for 60% of Hacked WordPress Sites in 2023</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scylladb.com/\">ScyllaDB</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fortress.snicco.io/\">Snicco Fortress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://solidwp.com/security/\">Solid Security</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Feb 2024 18:27:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"WPTavern: ‘Support Inclusion in Tech’ is Fundraising to Sponsor More Marginalized WordPress Contributors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=154423\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"https://wptavern.com/support-inclusion-in-tech-is-fundraising-to-sponsor-more-marginalized-wordpress-contributors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3235:\"<p>Support Inclusion in Tech (SiNC) is now fundraising on the <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/support-inclusion-in-tech\">Open Collective (OC) Foundation</a>’s platform.

She advocates for a 5th freedom, envisioning “the freedom to experience a thriving community truly open to everyone through sharing of information about The WordPress Open Source Project at community events.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested candidates seeking travel and/or lodging assistance can confidentially register on the <a href=\"https://supportinclusionintech.com/apply-for-support/\">SiNC website</a>, entering an anonymous directory listing. SiNC then pairs them with sponsors who provide financial assistance by reimbursing necessary amounts. SiNC currently provides a Mentorship Program to all speaker applicants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, 60% of applicants received assistance, and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/shan003/\">Sharon Norah</a>, the co-lead for the WordPress Kampala community, became SiNC&#8217;s inaugural sponsored WordPress contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fundraising on Open Collective Foundation’s Platform</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>February is Black History Month and is the perfect opportunity to find long-term solutions to support the marginalized. Those interested can make one-time contributions to sponsor a speaker&#8217;s travel and/or accommodations. Winstina Hughes has been approached to explore expanding support to speakers participating in WordPress conferences beyond WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I reached out to Winstina, and this is what she had to say: “If absolute transparency speaks to your heart, this is my way to honor your donation and impact as we work together to reduce barriers to the full inclusion of underrepresented speakers worldwide,&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SiNC&#8217;s fundraising effort deserves recognition, especially in the current climate where <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/14/as-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-comes-under-legal-attack-companies-quietly-alter-their-programs.html\">companies face scrutiny</a> for their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, prompting many to reconsider and rebrand their initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope SiNC&#8217;s fundraising initiative succeeds, especially considering the discontinuation of another notable WordCamp assistance program, <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\">DonateWC by Ines van Dijk</a>, due to the lack of a volunteer team.

Recently one of those friends reached out to share his latest experience, and I’m here to say it is one of the crazier ones. For privacy reasons, I’ve changed the names of both parties as well as the name of the agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br /><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we all know, starting a business is not for the faint of heart. The statistics can be depressing as 20% of businesses fail within the first 2 years. Beating those stats and growing has become even more rare. After 10 years of being in business,finding and retaining skilled employees and developers has been the bane of Mike’s business growth, which is a crucial aspect of success for any agency. Mike as the lead developer and owner of WebEase, a US-based WordPress service agency, has recently had a lesson for others navigating the hiring landscape.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Background</strong>:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WebEase currently has a standard slate of full-time employees in various roles including, sales, marketing, customer support, operations, and design. What’s missing is another developer, as Mike is both owner and lead developer, building the business from the ground up. With the current situation as it is, Mike has struggled to keep up with adding needed features to the service, as well as customer requests, leading him to explore the option of hiring a senior developer to ease the workload.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The LinkedIn Connection:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Dave, a senior developer Mike discovered through <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\">LinkedIn</a> who was “open to work”. After a few LinkedIn messages, emails, and finally an official interview via Zoom, Mike offered Dave the job. The onboarding process went smoothly, and Dave appeared to be a perfect fit for the team, wasting no time in getting the required software stack set up and installed per Mike’s instructions. However, within just two weeks, red flags began to surface, with communication becoming a significant issue. Dave remained unresponsive on all channels, causing concern from Mike. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Shocking Revelation:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The situation took a dramatic turn when a third party from Ukraine contacted Mike via the website’s Contact Us form. They were claiming that they had not received payment for work performed for WebEase. At this point, Mike was a bit confused. Who were these people in the Ukraine? They did reference Dave in the contact form, but Mike was honestly baffled at that moment. To Mike&#8217;s surprise, it was revealed that Dave had subcontracted the work to an overseas company without informing anyone at WebEase.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Digging Deeper:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand the extent of the situation, Mike logged into the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a> repo with <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VS Code</a> and utilized the <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=waderyan.gitblame\">Git Blame</a> tool. This revealed the true scope of the situation, leaving Mike not only concerned about missed deadlines but also alarmed by the unknown developers who had gained access to WebEase&#8217;s codebase. Had they added code that could leave his customers exposed in any capacity? Realizing the severity of the situation, Mike took swift action, halting the outstanding payments to Dave(Mike pays his contracts using a credit card), informing Dave of what he had found, and emphasizing the potential irreparable damage to the sale of his company, which is currently in negotiations with a valuation starting at 6 million USD. In response, Dave denied any wrongdoing but faced with undeniable evidence, threatened legal action against WebEase. Mike stood his ground, asserting that Dave’s actions constituted fraud and posed a significant threat to the integrity of WebEase&#8217;s source code.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Aftermath:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After documenting the entire situation with numerous screenshots of the emails between them, Mike&#8217;s credit card company sided with him, halting all payments to Dave as well as performing a chargeback for a few charges that had already been processed. Despite Dave’s initial defiance, he eventually went silent once again, not only leaving Mike to reflect on the red flags he had missed during the hiring process but also having to schedule time to review any code that was touched by Dave and the subcontracted developers. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, where is Mike now? He is still searching for that honest senior developer though sadly, he has fallen further behind on adding features that would benefit his customers as code review takes time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it turns out that Mike is not alone with this experience as there are just too many bad actors out there trying to make a quick buck and take advantage of over worked business owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My hope is that other business owners/WordPress agencies can learn from Mike&#8217;s story, emphasizing the importance of due diligence, effective communication, and a vigilant approach to safeguarding the integrity of their codebase and business operations.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Feb 2024 01:15:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Adam Silver\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: WordPress Photo Festival 2024, A Five Part Retrospective, Part 2, Volunteers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=154383\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-photo-festival-2024-a-five-part-retrospective-part-2-volunteers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31923:\"<p>From February 3-10 the Kerala, India WordPress community hosted an International Photos event, to both boost the number of photos at https://wordpress.org/photos as well as increase the number of contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this series we&#8217;ll talk with organizers, volunteers, and participants about how the event went as well as the community team, about how this event is a model for the second generation WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In this particular we&#8217;ll meet volunteers Sadie-Michaela, Chetan, and Yogesh.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is available in Video, Audio, and transcribed text.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Audio Edition</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transcription</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:00:00]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Welcome to day two of our series on the WP Photos event that happened earlier this month.

We&#8217;re going to start today with Sadie. All right, welcome.

Is that them <span>[00:01:00]</span> behind you in your screenshot?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:01]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> Yes, right behind me in my screenshot. That&#8217;s Loch Glascarnoch just down the road from where I live. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:05]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> That&#8217;s beautiful. You are blessed to live in such a wonderful place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:10]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> I just said it is very lovely, very beautiful. I do feel very blessed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:14]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Um, so we&#8217;re here to talk today about volunteering for the, um, international photos event that took place recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you were a volunteer, correct? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:25]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> I was a volunteer. Yeah, volunteer for the photos festival in Kerala. Yeah, earlier this month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:33]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> What were your tasks? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:36]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> I made I moderated photos. And I made a short video about how to for people that were new to the photo directory, and how to upload and start sending in their contributions, I guess would be the way to describe it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:52]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right, that sounds really cool. Little tutorial. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I didn&#8217;t know you made videos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:59]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> <span>[00:02:00]</span> I don&#8217;t normally I just they asked could I do it? So I just thought </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:04]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Well, there you are. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:04]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> I had to follow screenshots and stuff to, yeah, screenshots and talk, talk through it and then share the shots on the, on the same, um, blog post that we added it to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it was, it was an amateurish job. Do pop by and have a look. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:17]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> I will. What do you think? Um, have you volunteered at a remote event before?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:22]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> Oh, sorry. I&#8217;ve volunteered, but nothing to do with WordPress. I&#8217;ve done other things, but my roles in other things, but nothing to do with WordPress, it was my absolute first, um, first, first opportunity to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, it was good fun. What did you think? I really enjoyed it. Um, I met obviously the people that I didn&#8217;t know before that were part of it chatting behind the scenes, um, the guys over in India and. We had a prolific amount of, uh, photos that were submitted. It&#8217;s certainly over, I definitely over 1500. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was really, it was a really successful <span>[00:03:00]</span> event. I felt and, uh, so many different, um, photographs, you know, as it always is, but, um, yeah, just really good, really, really positive people were engaging on social media or. Twitter mainly that I saw it shared on, um, so yeah, it was nice. People got involved and it swelled the directory for people to use on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:03:19]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you interact much with other volunteers? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:03:28]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> I interacted more, just a couple, couple of them with the guys that actually were running it. Um, and not so much hugely outside of that because, um, probably to do with different time zones of where we all are. So on times when I had some time to moderate on photos or get involved with things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not so much beforehand. Um, a little bit with the, the main guy that was, or, um, organizing it that I was interacting with, um, okay. Out there in Kerala. And, uh, he was the one that said, oh, you <span>[00:04:00]</span> know, can you, can you make a video for this? So that was, you know, sort of things that were happening behind the scenes and just messaging back and forth on Slack about what was coming up in the few days that were in the runup to the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, blocks going up and stuff like that. You know, there was a special website for the, for the event. Um. On the Word camp site. And, uh, yeah, it was just, um, people slowly contributing bits of other things. There were other people that had made videos on different kind of topics as well. So, yeah. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:04:29]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Um, the reason I&#8217;m asking these questions is because in a, in an in-person event, the volunteers often have a meeting at the beginning where they&#8217;re all together and then they work together, is in the halls and, and all of that. And it is a very different thing with, uh, a remote event. Um, did you feel well supported?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like you had everything you needed to do? The tasks that were set before you? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:04:51]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> Yeah, I think so. I mean, the only tasks really I was doing was that I made the video ahead of time and moderating photos. And I do <span>[00:05:00]</span> that anyway outside of the event for the directory. So I didn&#8217;t feel it was, um, yeah, I didn&#8217;t feel anything really unnatural at all, I have to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was. It was good. Yeah, I don&#8217;t know. Maybe it&#8217;s I guess maybe it depends on the kind of person you are. And if you need reassurance, I could say that from my own side, I work for my own quite independent. So somebody else might, especially if they&#8217;ve been at an in person event, may find it a little bit different, shall we say, but not from I found it fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:34]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. All right. Um, yeah, I&#8217;ve been quite encouraged by all that I&#8217;ve heard from from everyone who&#8217;s volunteered. Um, it, it went well, um, the post pandemic events and some post pandemic events have really changed how, uh, remote events work, the quality, um, the, the significance and <span>[00:06:00]</span> things like that. It used to be a remote event was kind of slapdash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, everybody get on zoom and we&#8217;ll talk for a while and we&#8217;re done and they&#8217;re quite different. Now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:06:13]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> No, I completely agree. Even things, you know, in a smaller environment here where I am, I&#8217;m a community counselor and we&#8217;ve we held all our meetings because we needed to during the pandemic by zoom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve continued on because we, we live great distances apart and our area is so big. So especially during the winter months, it&#8217;s hugely helped have it going more professional and doing via zoom and teams and stuff. It&#8217;s really been helpful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:06:43]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Well, that&#8217;s really great. Uh, would you do it again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:06:50]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> Oh, definitely. Yeah, absolutely. I would. Yeah. I jumped on this one because it was, um, photo specific and I do, you know, I&#8217;m a prolific photo taker. Um, So <span>[00:07:00]</span> I like being involved in that. Um, but I would definitely, I wanted to go to a WordCamp and I thought there was going to be one, um, in England actually, although I&#8217;m up in Scotland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it, it was advertised for a date last year and then it never materialised. So I&#8217;m not sure what happened with that. Yeah, it would be lovely to have something like that in Inverness. I would champion. Oh yes. Inverness, yeah, beautiful part of the world. And yeah, plenty of WordPress users up here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:07:27]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is apply. Maybe I&#8217;ll You could be, you could be able to eat organizer. Yeah. Maybe I&#8217;ll, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:07:36]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> maybe I&#8217;ll, how far in? I found they seem to be quite well planned. I know that those, um, word Camp Europe, for example, um, is Oh, yes. Upcoming. Been in the planning. Well, I guess at least since the last one that, um, took place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-Hmm. . Yeah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:07:52]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Do you plan WordCamp Europe? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:07:54]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> I&#8217;m, like this, I&#8217;m quite busy and it&#8217;s quite far away, um, from where I am. So, <span>[00:08:00]</span> never say never, because I don&#8217;t ever say ever, but, um, never. It would be fun. It would be fun to make and stay a few days either side. Yeah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:08:11]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Uh, well, I very much appreciate your time. I, uh, I&#8217;m excited to hear about your volunteering and how it went.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m excited to hear that you liked it and, and we&#8217;ll come back. Uh, do you have any advice for anybody else? Uh, both, both for bonus events and just regular remote events, uh, for </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:08:32]</span> <strong>Sadie-Michaela:</strong> volunteering. I would just say jump in and get involved and enjoy it. You&#8217;re sure to enjoy it. Um, yeah. Friendly, just jump in, have a go, give it a go would be my, my advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:08:46]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> After I finished talking with Sadie, I talked with Chetan from India. All right. I&#8217;m here with Chetan. And, uh, did you tell me your, your full name and where you live? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:08:59]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> Hi, <span>[00:09:00]</span> I&#8217;m Chetan Trizavati. I&#8217;m living in Ahmedabad, it is in India. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:05]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. Um, how far from Kerala? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:10]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> It&#8217;s like, uh, around two hours flight from here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:14]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So, yeah. All right. That&#8217;s quite a ways. And, uh, you were a volunteer at the photos event? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:23]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> Uh, yes, uh, I was a volunteer. I was helped to write the content in our local language. So people in our local language can understand how to contribute in Photo Festival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:35]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Sure. I heard that a lot of the documentation was in many languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, and you&#8217;re the first person I&#8217;ve met who actually wrote that. Um, what language was it? It was in Gujarati. Okay. Um, that&#8217;s really, that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:09:50]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> That&#8217;s one of the things I admire about this event is that it was mostly people know, uh, they want to contribute, they don&#8217;t know how to start. So it will <span>[00:10:00]</span> help a local contributor </p>\n\n\n\n<p>as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:10:03]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Sure. Um, what other roles did you have? Or was that it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:10:12]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> So, uh, I was, uh, like, uh, contributing to our, uh, community as well. So I, uh, more about the local community. They can participate. So, uh, I was, uh, like, uh, helping other contributors as well. Okay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:10:30]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Um, I was, uh, this is, this is a virtual event and at, at, um, in person events, a lot of times the volunteers are near each other, they hang out, they go to dinner for, you know, to get together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t happen with virtual. Did you spend any time working with any other volunteers? Or were you just on your own most of the time? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:10:52]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> Uh, uh, in virtual we don&#8217;t spend as much time like in physical event. But, uh, whatever you have a question, we directly <span>[00:11:00]</span> ask in our chatting or like we facing this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can we help? So it is more like a connection on our messaging. Okay. That makes sense. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:13]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Um, I, I am a strong proponent of both in person and virtual events for different reasons, and they both have their benefits and drawbacks. And I think one of the drawbacks is that the volunteers don&#8217;t get to assemble in one place and share and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but it still sounds like it was a good event. Did you, did you have a good time and, and you would take place again? You would do it again? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:38]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> Yes, definitely. Because it&#8217;s a nice initiative to contribute so people can, they can upload whatever their creativity. Also, they want the good price. So they&#8217;re more encouraged by their contribution as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:52]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yes. Uh, did you contribute photos? Yes, I did. How many? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:11:59]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> Yeah. <span>[00:12:00]</span> Yeah. I, I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>16 photos were, uh, selected and with the WP Kerala because there are many photos in pending. So people are running with the photos. So we have to wait for our photos. Uh, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:19]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Um, did you seek out the role of volunteer or did someone come to you and say, please, will you volunteer? Um, um, did you go seeking the role of volunteer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or did someone come to you and ask you to be a volunteer? Uh, uh, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:42]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> actually the lead organizer was, uh, asked me to help. How can, uh, how can we help? So I said, I definitely can help. So, uh, in our local community, because we have one of the large community in India. So it was, uh, uh, very good opportunity to <span>[00:13:00]</span> contribute for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ask them, whatever I can do, I&#8217;ll definitely </p>\n\n\n\n<p>help them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:13:08]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Excuse me. It sounds like they did a really good job reaching out because they reached out to me as well, and I know they reached out to other people around the world and I think that&#8217;s kind of kind of key, rather than wait for people to show up and say, here I&#8217;m going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, to actually reach out and ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:13:23]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> Yeah, because sometimes people don&#8217;t know how to contribute because if, uh, if he had the, I don&#8217;t know, there is voluntary as well, because mostly in what you live in the, we hardly find volunteers, but he come to me that he needs help to promote the event. So it was really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They need to do the core guys can contact all the people to help them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:13:46]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Sure. Yeah. My, my talk at WordCamp Asia last year was, was titled the power in the asking. Um, yeah, there is power in asking people to help. That&#8217;s always help. Yes. Yeah. <span>[00:14:00]</span> That&#8217;s always help. Yeah. Um, do you have any advice? Do you have any advice for people doing just virtual events, working, working virtual events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:14:12]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> Uh, for that they have to communicate like, uh, Uh, creating a post that they can, uh, get idea what is going to happen on each day with it. Because in virtual people, uh, don&#8217;t get usually the focus on the time, but for example, physical there are physical available in virtual, they can live in between of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the, they have to be some, uh, good ideas, some good creativity so they can, uh, attract more. How can that, that even get helpful or they can even contribute for themselves. Okay, that&#8217;s great. For example, for example, the photo festival, they have a good prizes. So people increase more, they can contribute as more as photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they can, in reward, they can also <span>[00:15:00]</span> get some prizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:15:02]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Okay. Do you have any advice for someone who might do another photos event like this? So imagine if it were not done at Kerala. Some, some other groups that were going to do the same thing. What would you tell them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:15:14]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> Oh, yeah. So, uh, in one they have to, uh, ask, uh, many volunteers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They can, uh, help to approve photos because in the, uh, in this event we are faced like a lot of people are waiting to approve their photos. Also, some sometime takes, were notating adding, but we all know that this is contributor as a volunteer because we have to wait as well. So in advance, if we can ask other people to contribute to like, uh, approval photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they can have a good amount of people they can help to upload photos so other people can contribute. So in less time they can get approval for the photos as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:15:53]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Okay. That&#8217;s pretty great. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:15:56]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> Um, I&#8217;m excited to see more <span>[00:16:00]</span> photo events. Uh, I think it&#8217;s pretty ideal for a virtual event. Um, and I&#8217;d like to see They have almost 12, 000 photos submitted in this event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:10]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Ah, yeah. Um, I like that it was based in a city but not Only in that city. So this one was Kerala. I&#8217;d like to see one in, uh, Sydney, Australia, or I&#8217;d like to see one, you know, any, any other city, um, and then see a bounce around the world to see how each city presents sort of like the Olympics or, or a global work camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know what I mean? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:42]</span> <strong>Chetan:</strong> Yeah, it is like a city, but, uh, in Kerala is state. So, uh, for example, Kochi has a word game, but at this time, Yeah, this is the Kerala Photo Festival, so it is based on the street, but, uh, it is virtually one, so anyone can participate, <span>[00:17:00]</span> so mostly people have participated as much as they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:06]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yes. Well, thank you for your time. This has been really helpful. I&#8217;m excited to include you in my story. Thank you so much. My final volunteer for this episode is Yogesh. Hello there, can you tell me your full name and where you live? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:24]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> Okay, my name is Yogesh, Yogesh Londe. I live in Bangalore, India. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:31]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> And where&#8217;s Bangalore, generally speaking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>North? South? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:35]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> Bangalore is south of India. It&#8217;s like right in the middle of the southern, towards the southern tip of India. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:43]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Oh, okay. The warm </p>\n\n\n\n<p>part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:17:46]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> Lovely, yeah. It&#8217;s warm part, but because of our altitude, we have cooler weather. Whenever it rains, whenever we have humidity, it&#8217;s lovely weather. It&#8217;s the city of perpetual springs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, <span>[00:18:00]</span> well, that sounds like a great place to visit. You should, yes, definitely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:18:05]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. Well, we&#8217;re here today to talk about your role as a volunteer in the recent WP Photos event. Um, so let&#8217;s just dive right in. What was your task as a volunteer? What did you volunteer to do? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:18:20]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> Yeah, as a volunteer? Um, as a volunteer, uh, for the photo, uh, WP Photo , I was, my only task was to al uh, the attendees on the Zoom call at the inaugural and at the, it&#8217;s a tiny task, but I love doing it because it was, I was contributing to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s fantastic event that we sure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:18:49]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Something I noticed on the, on the page for volunteers. There are many, many volunteers and from the ones I&#8217;ve talked to, they each had a very small job, which I kind of like because. <span>[00:19:00]</span> Yeah, it allows volunteers to, to be full attendees and not have to work the whole time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but why did you get, why did you, uh, did you get selected for that job or did you choose that job? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:13]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> I chose that job. I volunteered, uh, to do something for the WPS and I was, I was selected for this. Okay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:28]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. Um, have you volunteered at a remote event before? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:36]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> I did volunteer, uh, remote event before with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the events was with you. The. Yes. Uh, word Fest Live, which went Yes. Word </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:50]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Fest. Yeah, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:52]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> word Live twice. And, uh, I was an organizer at Word Camp India, uh, 2021. It was <span>[00:20:00]</span> online year, remotely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:01]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Oh, I remember that. Yeah. Um, how does, how does this event compare? &#8217;cause those are, well, I guess, uh, one was a word camp word dress was not a camp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, although it felt like one, um, how does it compare? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:17]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> Oh, well, this one is a very unique event. The focus was only on contributing to WordPress photo directory. And that&#8217;s a fantastic way to contribute to an open source project, especially, specifically WordPress. So the entry bar is quite low, so anybody can participate, anybody can take a lovely photo and, uh, share it with the world saying that I took this photo and you can use it the way you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the only condition to contribute to WordPress photo directory. <span>[00:21:00]</span> And that was, um, that was what the whole WP Photo Kerala was about. So. That way, the, the, the aim of the program was, uh, contributing to WordPress Photos. So that way, the work that I was supposed to do was very little, minimal work, and it was very easy, but enjoyable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:21:26]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> I&#8217;m really glad to hear that. Um, you know, I&#8217;ve been working on this story for a week and a half now, and I&#8217;m just now realizing how non exclusive, how inclusive this event was, um, a word camp by its very nature is exclusive. You pick 20 speakers and everybody else. Doesn&#8217;t take part. But with, with this photos event, every single person who showed up could <span>[00:22:00]</span> totally take part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:22:02]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> Everybody is&#8230; it&#8217;s everybody&#8217;s event. My event is organized this event. I, I also clicked some photos and I contributed during this event. Um, yeah, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:22:13]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> well, that&#8217;s really cool. Um, was there, uh, what was internal communication like? Between volunteers, between volunteers and organizers, et cetera. Was there an organized system or was it just kind of track people down as you, as you need?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:22:38]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> Um, I, I&#8217;m not sure I was not on any of the, I, I&#8217;m not sure if the organizing team has their own Slack channel or anything, but, uh, I am, I communicated with the organizing team over, uh, uh, make WP Slack. And <span>[00:23:00]</span> whenever they need it, they will get in touch with me over WhatsApp or phone call because I&#8217;m, uh, I&#8217;m regularly in touch with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I was given a primer what my role was. This is what you&#8217;re supposed to do. And if you need help, just contact me. And since my task was very minimal, so I didn&#8217;t need the specialized training or anything. And so I was just doing that task with Marshall. Muting or, uh, asking them to, you know, uh, turn on their microphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those, those were simple tasks, which I am already well aware of. So I did not need much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:23:45]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. Um, I&#8217;ve been, as I&#8217;ve been watching the event, that&#8217;s like. I didn&#8217;t watch the event very well. I was ill, but I&#8217;m looking back at it and I&#8217;m trying to think about, <span>[00:24:00]</span> um, what was done and why and how, how it might get done better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s perfect. I have noticed some things that are just really spot on and, and couldn&#8217;t be done better. Um, so I&#8217;m trying to decide if better communication is needed. And it sort of sounds like no, from the volunteers I&#8217;ve spoken to, like, no, I just, I was told what to do and I did my thing and, and it&#8217;s all good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:24:25]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> Communication was just enough, just enough. So it was not overload of, you know, just enough, but, uh, even their, uh, communication over the website was fantastic. That was fantastic. Tell me about that. Attended was fantastic. You know, the, the blog posts on, uh, WP Photos Kerala were, um, was actually how to contribute to WordPress Photos directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many Indian languages. So, they had Maharashtra, <span>[00:25:00]</span> Tamil, Bengali, Nepali, Marathi. So many languages. So they&#8217;re like, you know, as you said, it was inclusive. Anybody who could, who wanted to learn how to contribute to what this photo directory, they could just go to the website and say, Oh, there is already a post in my own language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I don&#8217;t understand it very well, I could read that post in my own language and understand, yes, that&#8217;s so easy. What am I supposed to do? How do I do it? What are the conditions? And that&#8217;s, that makes sense. So. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, uh, it&#8217;s fantastic at many levels. Number one, it makes it inclusive. Everybody&#8217;s welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what language you speak, which part of India, what language you speak, everybody&#8217;s welcome. Number two is they got the community involved. The people who do only translation, polyglot community. They don&#8217;t do anything. I mean, they might not have the skills to do a <span>[00:26:00]</span> photo edit, uh, photo approvals, uh, other, uh, coding, other things, but they were involved and they became part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And, uh, so they got people excited about, uh, contributing to WordPress by translating, which is interesting. So it went across. Disciplines. Yes. Cross discipline collaboration. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:29]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So I have a question for you. Um, I&#8217;ve made content in the past, targeted at India, and I&#8217;ve considered translating it. But I&#8217;ve been told by many people, I think maybe even by you, that English is all we need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, yes. People speak English, that it&#8217;s not needed. What made this special? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:49]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> So, okay. Now, that&#8217;s, you&#8217;re right. So English is all we need when we come to WordPress dashboard. Or, uh, website menu, or, uh, <span>[00:27:00]</span> contact us page, or, uh, about us, uh, con, contact details. But when you want, when you want to tell the story, or when you want to give detailed instructions, uh, there are people who will benefit reading it in their own mother tongue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as, as, uh, as I, I&#8217;m saying. In case of Heropress, there are some essays which are already written by the author in their own mother tongue and in English. So, I like to read the essays, for example, in Marathi. I like to read the essays, for example, in some of the languages, like Persian. So, those essays, as you said previously, when people write in their own mother tongue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no accent. Or when I&#8217;m reading in somebody&#8217;s mother tongue, that essay is without any accent. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:27:55]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yes. There&#8217;s no accent when you write in your own mother tongue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:27:59]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> That&#8217;s true. <span>[00:28:00]</span> That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s true. So I enjoy reading stories when people tell stories, narrate stories in their own mother tongue. That&#8217;s special.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same way, um, the documentation should be in the mother tongue because there are terms which people understand better in their own mother tongue. So for me, yes, I, I would read documentation predominantly in English, my first choice would be already English because I&#8217;ve always been doing that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:32]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many people that makes good sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:42]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> And so that, that way that it did make it special this time, yes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And I, you know, I&#8217;ve had other people say that even if their English is excellent, knowing the other person took the time to translate it for their convenience <span>[00:29:00]</span> is special. Oh, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>yes. Oh, yes. Yes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:10]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right. Uh, I don&#8217;t have any more questions for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really appreciate your time. Thank you for coming. Thank you for taking part in the photos project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:18]</span> <strong>Yogesh:</strong> Uh, lovely chatting with you. I have enjoyed talking to you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:23]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. And that brings us to the end of day two of our series about the WP photos project that took place internationally. Today, we spoke with volunteers tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked with some attendees and find out what it was like to go to an event where you didn&#8217;t necessarily rub elbows with anyone else, but everybody was there. See you tomorrow.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Feb 2024 21:28:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Topher DeRosia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Gravatar: Gravatar Manifesto: One Profile, Everywhere\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=1057\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/02/27/gravatar-manifesto-one-profile-everywhere/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5744:\"<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Beyond the avatar with new, open-source tools</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">Gravatar has been a humble profile picture service for over two decades. Your globally recognized avatar, linked to an email address, traveling with you around the web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">With many <em>billions</em> of avatars served across sites like WordPress.com, Slack, GitHub, and ChatGPT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">We want to give you a preview of the next evolution of Gravatar. Building on our legacy by empowering users to claim control of their digital identities and equipping developers with the open-source tools they need to build a better web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A New Approach to Identity</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-4-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1195\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar redefines online identity by linking it to an email address rather than a name. This subtle yet profound difference opens a world of possibilities — allowing you to curate multiple profiles for various facets of your life, whether work, family, or play.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even be anonymous. We support that, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On sites and apps integrated with Gravatar, easily import and share profile details like your avatar, bio, and interests for a seamless and engaging experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Online Business Card</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-5-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1196\" />\n\n\n\n<p>What’s old is new again, and Gravatar is the original ‘link-in-bio’ tool. Every Gravatar account comes with a free public profile page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t visited your profile in a while, now is an excellent time to check out the recent updates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the convenient QR code to share with those you meet in real life, replacing old-fashioned business cards. Add links to your social accounts, contact information, calendars, payment methods, and more. Look for new integrations and personalization settings in the months to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Privacy First Profiles</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-6-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1197\" />\n\n\n\n<p>With Gravatar, you always decide what information gets shared and when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may choose to have your avatar and display name public. But you may want information like your phone number or your birthday private. Gravatar will ask you to confirm before sharing non-public data with a new site or app. And we’ll soon have tools to help keep up with where profile data is used.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users set permissions, developers build worry-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A major benefit of Gravatar is that if you need to update any information, you can just do it once.&nbsp; The change is then instantly available to every site you’ve shared it with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let’s Kill Passwords</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-8.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1198\" />\n\n\n\n<p>We will soon release a new passwordless authentication service that can be added to any website or app. Logging in with Gravatar will be the simplest way to bring your profile with you to new sites and services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stolen passwords result in data breaches and identity theft. Passwords are also a pain for all of us to manage, reset, and remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going passwordless with Gravatar&#8217;s oAuth service transforms login experiences by ditching traditional usernames and passwords for a more secure, convenient, and future-proof approach. It eliminates common vulnerabilities and reduces support drama around forgotten passwords or locked-out accounts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar&#8217;s authentication prioritizes your security. We use open standards, offer seamless Passkey integration, and provide free, developer-friendly tools (a WordPress plugin, mobile SDKs, and more).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Powerful APIs For Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://gravatar.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/image-7-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1199\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar&#8217;s APIs offer developers unparalleled flexibility and power to customize user experiences using Gravatar profile data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The existing free API allows for easy implementation of avatars and basic profile details across websites and applications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later this year, a new paid API service will extend this functionality with access to more data users have opted to share, including job titles, interests, contact details, and social connections. This expanded dataset will open up new possibilities for developers around e-commerce, CRM, content algorithms, fraud detection, and personalized user experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>End users will always control when and if their data is shared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By leveraging Gravatar&#8217;s APIs, developers can significantly reduce user onboarding friction and tap into a vast network of millions of profiles for a more interconnected web experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Join Us On This Journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar fosters a more connected, accessible, and user-centric internet.&nbsp;We are just getting started.

That’s sort of what happened to the FSE Outreach Program, newly launched as plain <em>Outreach</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The longtime facilitator of this initiative, Automattic Product Wrangler Anne McCarthy, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/09/07/evolving-the-fse-outreach-program/\">announced the upcoming changes</a> in September 2023:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>What started as an</em> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/05/01/an-experimental-outreach-project-for-full-site-editing/\"><em>experimental program in May 2020</em></a><em> with the expectation that the Site Editor would ship in the following 6 or so months turned into nearly 3.5 years of feedback loops, knowledge sharing, and community building. With WordPress 6.3 bringing Phase 2 to completion, it’s time for the FSE Outreach Program to evolve alongside the broader WordPress project and needs.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The intention was to “get feedback about pain points to the right people faster and help keep us on track for Phase 2”. We did this! You did this.</em><br /><em>All good things must come to an end–or they need to adapt to continue to stay relevant. </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the culmination of consistent commitment to both expand the scope of testers and to nudge users to experiment with new features:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>The primary goal is to help improve the Full Site Editing experience by gathering feedback from WordPress site builders [&#8230;] the program also seeks to grow awareness and ability with full site editing features.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As the adoption of the Site Editor (nee FSE, or Full Site Editing)<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-2023-survey-block-editor-on-the-rise-positive-feeling-about-contributing-drops\"> continues to grow</a>, it’s time to refocus on discoverability and redefine the program’s goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Extending the Test Team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step—renaming the Making WordPress Slack channel to<a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C015GUFFC00\"> #outreach</a>—has been completed. But as culture has taught us—from William Shakespeare to failed rebranding endeavors—a new name doesn’t change the nature of the object it delineates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack, leading the new program, sees Outreach as an enablement platform where site builders and extenders collaborate with core developers. With teammates Justin Tadlock and Nick Diego, she’ll coordinate the effort to recalibrate the program to further this partnership and deepen the community’s trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In her <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/01/29/proposal-whats-next-for-the-outreach-program/\">proposal post on the Core blog</a>, Pauli-Haack listed several use cases for the rebranded channel, aiming to keep it approachable, friendly, and wide-ranged—a destination for WordPress newcomers and professionals alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The FSE Outreach program made it clear that connecting in this channel facilitated participants’ first contributions and lowered the barrier to connecting with the open-source project,” says Pauli-Haack, clarifying that “because site builders and extenders regularly intersect, the channel’s content will be relevant to both user groups. There’s a lot of overlap of interests and concerns.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outreach will be a place to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Connect with Developer Hours and Hallway Hangouts presenters beyond the live event.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Resurface relevant content from the Dev Chat about upcoming features and call for testing from various teams.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Collect feedback on breaking changes in future releases and provide answers and workarounds.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allow design and engineering teams to tap into this extended user base for input on GitHub issues and Trac tickets.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Arrange ad hoc working groups for issues raised across social media that are outside the scope of the Support team.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Provide support and resources to Meetup organizers.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than a link between support and marketing or even a dedicated end-user-oriented developer advocacy initiative, Pauli-Haack thinks of Outreach as an extension of the Test team: “It is part of the open-source process to build the software and close feedback loops, ideally before the next version is released or to help improve the current functionality. It is part of user testing in a broader sense.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A welcome side effect of the original program was the comeback of the Test team, whose members now post regular updates and proactively share testing instructions aimed at non-developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No Bug Reports Needed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two comments posted in response to the “What’s next” post echoed a long-standing obstacle, particularly for casual, non-technical contributors: how to encourage them to share feedback while lowering the barrier to entry associated with GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How will Outreach address these issues?<br /></strong>“The program is another way for site builders and developers to get comfortable contributing and collaborating on the open-source project. Any constructive and problem-oriented feedback is welcome, especially if it doesn’t fit into the guardrails of a bug report or a feature request. By discussion and collaboration, we discover the next steps to a possible solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also an opportunity for extenders to find an open ear for airing pain points on extending WordPress. Part of the extender Outreach is the Extensibility Issues Triage initiative. Each month, contributors from agencies and extenders go through the project board of identified issues, try to move them forward to get them reviewed and ultimately merged.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Group Endeavor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/23/recap-hallway-hangout-whats-next-for-the-outreach-program/\">recap of the Hallway Hangout</a> dedicated to discussing these typical difficulties and possible ways to alleviate them, the team proposed actionable steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Set up a GitHub team that contributors can ping when they want to gather early feedback from users.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Encourage engineers to use the Outreach channel to request extenders’ feedback on new features earlier in development before they’re merged and shipped.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create a wishlist for upcoming releases to get users’ input on priorities. This overlaps with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/27/summary-hallway-hangout-triage-extensibility-issue/\">Extensibility Issues Triage</a> initiative.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>The goal is to make the Outreach Program more accessible and sustainable, improve collaboration across teams, and help guide WordPress development through early and ongoing user and contributor input.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming up with ideas is the easy part—making them happen is the real challenge. As Pauli-Haack mentioned, “This can only be a group endeavor if we want to broaden the reach and be a welcoming place for people interested in particular focuses of the software.“</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How will you ensure that the channel remains focused, and balances sometimes conflicting needs and interests?<br /></strong>“These are ideas that come from knowing that non-contributors need to connect with contributors. We want to ensure an ongoing humming in the channel, letting people know what’s happening. As this is still a young initiative, we will see what will come of it. It’s version one, and we will continue to iterate.”</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Feb 2024 10:00:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Ronny Shani\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"Do The Woo Community: The Collaboration of the Interactivity API with WordPress and WooCommerce\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=79149\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://dothewoo.io/interactivity-api-collaboration-wordpress-woocommerce/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:481:\"<p>WordPress and WooCommerce devs Carlos Bravo and Lucio Giannotta discuss the collaboration of WordPress core and Woo with the Interactivity API, a new framework for developers.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/interactivity-api-collaboration-wordpress-woocommerce/\">The Collaboration of the Interactivity API with WordPress and WooCommerce</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce and WordPress Builder Podcast</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Feb 2024 10:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: WordPress Photo Festival 2024, A Five Part Retrospective, Part 1, Organizers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=154319\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-photo-festival-2024-a-five-part-retrospective-part-1-organizers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39857:\"<p>From February 3-10 the Kerala, India WordPress community hosted an International Photos event, to both boost the number of photos at https://wordpress.org/photos as well as increase the number of contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this series we&#8217;ll talk with organizers, volunteers, and participants about how the event went as well as the community team, about how this event is a model for the second generation WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this particular we&#8217;ll meet organizers Bigul Malayi and Ajith R N.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is available in Video, Audio, and transcribed text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Audio Edition</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transcription</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:00:00]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Hello!

We&#8217;ll talk to organizers, volunteers, and participants about how the event went as well as the community team, about how this event is a model for the second generation WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get started, I&#8217;d like to provide some background for the event. At the State of the Word 2021, Matt announced the WP Photos project. A project to have the WordPress community submit photos for use by anyone in the world for any <span>[00:01:00]</span> purpose. As of today, there are over 15, 000 photos available in the Photos repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 Photo Festival was an attempt to both boost the number of submitters as well as the number of photos. We begin our story talking with Biggle from Kerala. Biggle, can you tell me your full name and where you live? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:01:27]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Hi, good evening. I&#8217;m Bigul. My full name is e. Malai is my family name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m from,  South India, southern part of India. I live in a state called Kerala. And my city name is Kozhikode, Calicut. It is one, in the olden time it is very famous for,  what to say, spices. So many European traders came here for trading spices in the past. <span>[00:02:00]</span> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:00]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Were those, were those the Portuguese? Like I know the Portuguese would go up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:04]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yes, yes, yes. Exactly. He landed here. He was,  then he started the colonization of India. Uh, okay. So the Portuguese came here and before,  Portuguese, we were in trade with Arabs and Chinese,  traders. So,  my city,  has been in touch, direct contact with the,  foreigners, different traders from the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more than 800 years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:32]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Wow. That&#8217;s really impressive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:02:34]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> And,  if you, yeah. And for rest of the, my,  state Kerala is in touch with the spice spreading and tea,  lot of,  commodity spread here since the time of Greeks and Romans. Hmm. Maybe you can find,  the, some ships of Ella Malabar coast in,  so,  the Solomon episode of Bible also.<span>[00:03:00]</span> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:03:00]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Oh, yeah, I&#8217;ll bet. Yeah. Um, so we&#8217;re here today to talk about the WP photos event that happened there Uh, tell me about it. What is it for somebody who doesn&#8217;t know? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:03:13]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Okay. Um photo festival,  as everybody know,  We have no way to contribute back to weight plus since last two years and many people are involved in that project uh, because uh nowadays everyone carry good camera or Mobile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we were able to click nice shots wherever we go. So we have a lot of contributors to the,  wait portal directory. There are thousands of contributors and,  uh, from our in Kerala, we have five meetup groups. And most of the time we organized the meetups and where camps together m took at that. So,  uh, we noticed many people from,  our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a, uh. We have <span>[00:04:00]</span> three active with, with,  WhatsApp group and we have,  five meet groups also. So from there we noticed many,  people in our communities,  actively contributing to WebPress photo directory. And few of them,  the photos were selected in,  in our associated newsletters and uh,  also some other websites related to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Press. Uh, especially like a good number of times, zero press, et cetera. So,  as a token of appreciation, people love to contribute more back to the WordPress photos. So,  as per the,  current status, many,  bedcams. Uh, or waitress meetup groups are organizing a photo walk. So be impressed from,  waitress Tokyo group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they,  they used to do photo walks very often than other meetup groups. So <span>[00:05:00]</span> we decided to go,  something similar,  but they did so,  A few months back last year,  we went to a botanical garden nearby in Calicut,  that is hardly,  10 kilometers from my native,  I used to go there in the childhood,  because that botanical garden has a lot of,  plants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>where it is more than thousands of plant varieties, especially they have a garden for ginger and bananas. Uh, it sounds like </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:33]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> an ideal place for a photo walk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:05:35]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Photo walk. So we&#8217;ve been there and also they have,  they have a very good pond for lotus and, um, water lilies. So And we were able to take a lot of photos there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the funny thing is that actually we were only allowed to stay there for three hours, but that day we went there on a Sunday and that day was very rainy day and we were not able to <span>[00:06:00]</span> walk sometime because of the heavy rain. Thankfully, there were some,  kind of a shot,  uh, that way to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to say? Some kind of a hut. Yeah. A shed hut, hut, hut, or roughly shed there. So we, we were able to sit there and we were able to talk about WordPress and general web development things. So it&#8217;s like extended a WordPress day. And we were 15 people and, um, Then,  we took more than six hours,  to,  Rob around botanical cat</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And uh, thankfully that day there were a coffee bar nearby, or there is a coffee bar. Actually, they were serving food also in the working days, but Sundays are day for them, so we were able to only able to drink coffee until four evening . Nice. So, but,  the, at. Most of the year was very chilly,  because it is very cool and rain was most of the time it was raining and we were able to take very good <span>[00:07:00]</span> photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think more than 200 photos from that walk is already in the photo directory by different people. And a few are still remaining to upload those photos. Oh yeah. But still, it is very nice. After seeing,  that in those years from the,  and we also created few reels and . Sure. So it was very successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, yeah. When we shared it in the,  our community groups, meetup groups and uh,  WhatsApp group,  we got very good response then,  from the people and they want to be part of that. But,  in, so we thought that if we had taken 20 or 30 people to. Or a botanical garden,  because the photos will be similar,  because there is a limitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be many photo duplications. Not sure. Yes. Yes. There are a lot of chances for that. So,  we started to think about how we can have a photo contributed day <span>[00:08:00]</span> and how we can differentiate from a photo market. Then we came with the idea about it. Uh, it was a half day for the contribution day. And we organized it in last year after 23 weeks after the photo book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and it went very well. Uh, it it was in last November, and it went very well. We were able to contribute another 200 photos from and most of the participants were different part of Kerala. Uh, so more than 60 people attend that event also. So,  that was a very interesting,  feedback from the people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, but,  we,  there were a lot of positive feedbacks and one of the negative feedback was,  they&#8217;re not getting much time to contribute the photo. As we ah know. Uh, we can only upload,  five photo at a time and Right. We have to wait for the moderation. Uh, so we were looking for,  an option how we can, uh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can make a remedy for this and <span>[00:09:00]</span> what will be the exact solution for this when we are organizing a photo walk or photo contributor day. So people want to contribute more than 10 or 15 photos. And we have to, we have to consider it as a part of the event, these photo sessions. So we were thinking about different models and Finally, we came up with the idea that still few people don&#8217;t know what, why we should contribute the photos and what are the methods we have to follow, what are the things we have to take care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we decided to have a different format. Uh, we plan to organize a photo festival and it&#8217;s fully dedicated for the contribution of WordPress photo directory. And we decided to. Run it as a one week program on the first day, we organized two orientation, one in the,  Asian morning time zone and one in the hour evening time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the people from different <span>[00:10:00]</span> parts of the globe can attend even,  uh, the people from the American side also can attend because it will be early morning for them. So we organized two meetings. One is in the early morning time, time and evening time. So,  more than a hundred people attended both of the meetings,  all in one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they, at, they came to,  know more about how we can contribute to the photo directly and what all are the things we have to take her about. What is the relevance of a CCO license, et cetera. Sure. We had a very interactive discussion,  on the both sessions. And people started to contribute and the interesting fact that our goal for this photo festival was 1000 photos to the photo directory in a one week time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the first day itself, there are more than 400 photos submissions. And that is the first time the photo directory is facing that much load. Actually the moderators was busy. For the next one week, <span>[00:11:00]</span> because whenever you look to the photo directory, there will be more than 200 to 50 photos in the queue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even on the last day, there were,  we spent a lot of time on Friday and also Saturday morning. And then also there were more than 60 photos,  submitted for our photo festival. So that was an immense response. Our goal actually, as like I mentioned before, our goal was thousand photos, but we were able to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean the pupil sub contributor more than around two, 2000 photos. But as you know, we cannot, there, there are few of the photos around 400 plus photos. Were not up to the mark. They have. Yeah. It always happens. They were matching tower guidelines, so it happens. So we were, we had to reject those photos because they, most of them were not up to the market because of different issues like clarity paid,  et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So,  in, uh. After that also, even we <span>[00:12:00]</span> rejected 400 plus photos, there were,  thousand 544 photos contributed the WordPress photo directory as a part of that. And,  it is contributed by,  more than 160 contributors from different parts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:16]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just within one week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:17]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Right. Yeah, within one week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, the funny thing is that,  more than 300 people registered for the event, but thankfully only 170 people contributed. Otherwise, it will be a big, big, big, big,  delay will cause that to monitor the photos and moderate the photos. It will take a lot of, lot of time. It will not be possible to sort all the things in a one week time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So overall, we get a very good feedback and. It is,  it&#8217;s a nice way of contributing back to WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:12:53]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Uh, I do know the moderator struggled to keep up because they came in so quickly. Um, at one point <span>[00:13:00]</span> there was, I think a thousand in the queue. Um, I watch personally, I watch every photo go by in an RSS feed just for fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And,  there&#8217;s usually 40 or 50 in a day. And I got up over 2000 in my reader before I could start catching up. And so that was crazy. Um, I personally was ill during that time. So I wasn&#8217;t able to moderate or even attend. And so, and I&#8217;m one of the moderators. So,  that put extra weight on some of the others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, Marcus Burnett is a moderator and he was at a word camp. And so,  it was, it was a pretty stressful time. I don&#8217;t think anybody expected that volume. Um, and it was. It was pleasantly international. Uh, you know, it was India heavy, but that&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s that was. That&#8217;s your home, your home base. But I saw people from all over the world contributing, and that <span>[00:14:00]</span> was very encouraging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I&#8217;m excited to see other cities,  other States around the world,  pick up the mantle and. And do something similar, um, sort of like the Olympics, you know, where,  it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s international, but it&#8217;s really about the city. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:14:25]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yes. Yes. We can consider,  because,  after this,  when we can conclude the photo festival, most of the participants were checking when will be the next event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So of course we have to think about a bigger vision, maybe next year,  in a bigger manner. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:14:46]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Um, tell me about the future. Have you, have you already thought about,  doing another one yourself? Have you thought about, or has anybody approached you and said, Hey, we&#8217;d like to do this <span>[00:15:00]</span> also. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:15:01]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yeah, we got a very good feedback from the community because community,  because few approach, I mean, a few community organizers in touch with us, they, they.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>told told us that they will be doing something similar as a part of their webcam. Uh, not in a bigger, bigger manner, but a kind of a smaller version of this. Uh, so I, I hope,  it will be followed by,  many other communities and people want a bigger version of this. Uh, so maybe,  next year we can, we can plan a bigger one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I, in a sense, what I mean that,  actually that,  many people contributed more than 30, 40 photos and they want to contribute more. And also the thing is that. They were not getting enough time to contribute as they,  they want because,  many, <span>[00:16:00]</span> uh, participants conducted us through different social media channels, even a few of them contacted us directly, directly because they have our,  phone numbers or WhatsApp numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they ping me directly and say, why my photo is spending queue for last two days. I have tons of photos with me. I want to contribute. I want to contribute. What, well, when you will be moderate. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:25]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Uh, so that&#8217;s, that speaks to some of the logistics that we need to take care of. Yeah. Particularly around moderators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:31]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yeah. So yes, please carry on, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:36]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> but we have enough moderators for daily submissions. It&#8217;s working fine. Yes, exactly. But so that&#8217;s not going to scale. So, yeah, points that out. This is a good stress test for the for the system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:16:51]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yes, exactly. So, but we can do that. Uh, we can,  we can in touch with moderators. Uh, in advance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this time <span>[00:17:00]</span> we only pinged them, um, just around two weeks before the event. Next time we can make a,  a long plan and we can ping them in advance, two, three months advance. So they can be ready. They can devote some time on that particular two, three weeks. And we can give people,  more than a week or 10 days or 15 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributing to the WordPress photo directory. So everybody will get enough time to contribute their good photos to the photo directory. And also,  uh, so there will not be any hurry. So we will get enough submission also. And also as a moderator, we will get enough time to moderate it. And,  for,  for us, it will get enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>time to sort out the photos and announce the winners rather than we keep doing in a one or two days. Uh, so,  that is our plan. And also,  many people,  be discussed in person multiple <span>[00:18:00]</span> times. Many people want to contribute to the WordPress photo directory, but they&#8217;re not willing to create an account in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>org or they are not willing. Submit the photos one by one and when we, when we were,  sharing this group in a few of the professional photographers we know and they shared it in their WhatsApp group about this. Uh, so immediate response is that, is it possible to send the photos,  send the photos via email?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that is the normal practice. Yeah. Normal practice here. Uh, some,  when a online media or a,  regular media conduct the event for the photo festival like this,  for example, nature for the festival or,  by wildlife photograph festival. There are a few photo festivals happens here most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, by conducted by some organizations or online,  uh, agencies like that. They will only ask them to send the <span>[00:19:00]</span> photos we have made. So they were expecting the same from us. So,  we expect a few,  professional photographers participations, but unfortunately we only get less than 10,  from our state,  because of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So next time we will think of a way to include them also. Uh, so we have to work on that. Uh, we need,  if we get one or two volunteer to monitor this, we will surely consider this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:28]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. I know, I know that there are develop professional developers in the world who became professional developers because of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to be really curious to see if we get professional photographers. Grow out of this program. Yes, exactly. That would be really great. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:19:49]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yeah, we are hoping for that also. But there is also another problem is that,  they, they are ready to share a few of them are ready to share, but they are not willing to <span>[00:20:00]</span> share in a license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:02]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:03]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yes. That is a difficulty. Yeah, that&#8217;s a difficulty. And so at least we missed a few great photos because of that, but we can compromise with that,  because we, that&#8217;s one of the most important thing in our guideline. Sure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:21]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Um, I&#8217;ve given some thoughts to that and we, I think we as a community need to do a better job of communicating why it&#8217;s worthwhile to, for a professional to submit some photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, under the CC zero license, um, they never want to give anything away. It didn&#8217;t make sense. It it&#8217;s their culture. Um, but I think, I think we can convince them that it&#8217;s, that it&#8217;s worth it in some ways. Um, so that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s something we can learn from this project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:20:56]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yes. And also,  a few of <span>[00:21:00]</span> the,  Professional photos submitted in our,  Event as a part of this event get wider recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of them is,  selected as the 15, 000 photo. Yeah. There was a tweet from Waitress,  Twitter handle about,  15, 000 photos and one of the professional photos submitted as a part of the event is selected for that. Ah, that&#8217;s great. The one, maybe you remember the blue one, um, of uh,  Kingfisher, blue Kingfisher?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I do. It&#8217;s, yeah, it is selected as one of the,  best photos of,  our photo festival. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:21:40]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Ah, that&#8217;s great. Um, I&#8217;d like to talk to you for a few minutes about,  organizers. I noticed you have a lot of them. Mm-Hmm, . Um, my, my local work camp usually had four. What did you have 20 or something like that? <span>[00:22:00]</span> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:22:00]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yeah, I actually,  as I told you before,  we conducted, I mean, we organized this event as a,  on the band banner of it, the Scarlet community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, we have,  uh,  for community with respect to community here. So,  all these organizers from that group. Okay. And they are part of our,  last two, three bedcams also. And we worked as a team since we started. So all of them were part of this event in a different, different way. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:22:32]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So what kinds of, what kinds of different things did they do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, okay. So it&#8217;s not a, it&#8217;s not a word camp, so you&#8217;re not getting a venue. You&#8217;re not, you know, all that stuff. What, what did they do for this event? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:22:47]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Um, actually,  most of us were in the part of,  in the initial process itself. So,  as, as I described before, a few minutes before we started it as a <span>[00:23:00]</span> photo walk in the first, then we organized as a photo direct, I mean, a photo contributor after they contributed dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we decided to go for a photo festival. So all this idea came when we sit together,  in different Zoom calls. So all of them has their own suggestions and we were discussing about the, the, so it took three, four meetings,  That will from a photo up to photo festival. So everyone was part of the discussion and they were sharing their idea in our group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, so we have a WhatsApp group and telegram group for this. And also we have a slack group. So we were discussing a lot of things, how to, how to execute in a better manner. So,  a lot of suggestions came from all of these people and, and also they, they shared about this event in their,  all, all possible ways, like,  they&#8217;re in between their friends and <span>[00:24:00]</span> family in between their colleagues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. In a different way. So that is why we get a wider,  spread of this event in a short time, actually as a part. As a part of our budget, there was,  250 allocated for online campaign,  especially for the Instagram ads. Uh, but,  in the, on the first day, we, our plan was to execute it on, after we,  we organize the first orientation, the first day orientation and to wait for the response, how will be the response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thankfully,  we got a very good response on the first day itself because of this,  indirect collaboration with the people like friends, family, colleagues, et cetera. So that helped, that helped a lot. Uh, so we were able to,  do the promotions in a very short,  short time because of this wider <span>[00:25:00]</span> base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:25:01]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Right. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really like that. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m accustomed to a lead organizer deciding what the tasks are and then assigning them to as many contributors are as needed, which might be four or five or whatever for an event, or at a very large event, maybe, you know, a dozen or so. But I really like the idea of people coming to the meeting and saying, I think we should do this, and I&#8217;m willing to do the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I&#8217;m an organizer, you know, um, that&#8217;s very, very,  open source, you know, to come to the group and say, I&#8217;m going to do this work for this project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:25:47]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Actually, we always tell one thing, we always tell one thing here. Uh, we, we are trying to execute that. Like there is a famous verse from Three Musketeers, one for all, all for one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:25:59]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> <span>[00:26:00]</span> Yes. Yeah, that&#8217;s really great. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:04]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Okay. And also,  uh, the important thing is that we also get a very good support from other Indian community,  like,  for example, maybe you have noticed that,  Sadie has created a. video also pinged us to,  join us a volunteer. Uh, okay. So she created, she created a article,  she write, wrote an article in our,  event,  event site about how to contribute to web water directly with a good video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So people were able to,  if a people, if a person reading that article,  he or she will be able to,  get a clear understanding of how to contribute to a web photo directory. So, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:46]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> uh, that was translated too as well, right? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:26:48]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, so be conducted. So,  in our internal discussion,  this idea came that,  we can translate this, the article to different Indian languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we <span>[00:27:00]</span> conducted,  some of our, I mean, most of our community here, and we were able to, um, Translated to multiple languages like Tamil,  Canada, Hindi, Marti,  Gujarati, Bengali, Nepali. Okay. Uh, we have translated these master languages, so,  that&#8217;s really great. Yeah. So it, it,  it gave. , it, it, it helped us to get a,  uh, wider recognition e even in the community, and people were able to read,  read the article in their languages and they were able to,  contribute to the,  photo directory without much hassles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So,  it helped a lot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:27:43]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty cool. Um, I interviewed Sadie and,  in a couple of days he&#8217;ll be able to watch. Okay. Nice. The interview about her making that video. Okay. Um, I think that&#8217;s it <span>[00:28:00]</span> for today. Okay. I really appreciate your time. Okay. Thank you very much. Um, you&#8217;ve been very patient throughout the entire interview process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:09]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> It&#8217;s been a journey for both of us. It&#8217;s a pleasure to talk to you because you are one of our men in the photo. I thank you very much. Actually, we, we, we started to contribute after seeing the efforts you have taken for the photo directory, especially you, Michelle and Marcus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:31]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Uh, well, thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We really appreciate that. It&#8217;s nice to hear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:36]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> Okay. Thank you very </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:37]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> much. Bigul was not the only organizer by a long shot. There were quite a few. I also interviewed Ajith. So tell me your whole name and where you&#8217;re from. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:28:49]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Yeah. My name is Ajit R N. So I&#8217;m from Cochin, Kerala. It&#8217;s a Southern state of India.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:00]</span> So yeah, basically I live near. Uh in the middle of the sea and the mountains so Okay, it&#8217;s </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:08]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> uh, yeah, it&#8217;s on the uh, it&#8217;s on the Western shoreline, right? Yeah. Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Yeah, I know I kind of keep track of things by by their relation to mumbai and I know mumbai is about halfway down on the west And so you guys are like, so halfway between the bottom and Mumbai, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:30]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> No, actually South actually we are,  no, no, actually we are way below that. So we are the bottom part of the India on the left side. Okay. If you see Yeah. the hot part. . Yeah. . Yeah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:45]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So, yeah. Okay. So,  tell me what you did with the WP WP Photos event that happened recently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:29:54]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Okay. Uh, basically my role was to take care of all the <span>[00:30:00]</span> website and all the design side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did most of the website and all the facilitated all the things for the registration. And also we did some small apps to display the live feed of the photos. Oh, nice. Yeah. Right. Yep. Yeah. Also we got some leaderboard too. So anyway, since the event is over, I think that&#8217;s finalized. So yeah. Okay. So basically my role was to mostly doing all the technical stuff, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:30:38]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Your title was organizer. Yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s correct. I was surprised. There are quite a few organizers. What was it like 10 or something like that? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:30:46]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Something like that. So we basically,  we are a group of organizers. So,  whenever there&#8217;s an enemy, we call a meeting and everyone will <span>[00:31:00]</span> input, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:31:00]</span> <strong>Bigul:</strong> uh, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:31:02]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> we will do their parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. Yeah, since this was a,  we didn&#8217;t get enough time to prepare all. Uh, prepare for the event. So like we just got approval and in the next one week or one and a half week, we just, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s only a short amount of window. So most of us didn&#8217;t have free enough time to go through the whole process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a bunch of us came together and we did, and yeah, it&#8217;s, that&#8217;s basically. Okay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:31:43]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Um, Bigger mentioned he was the main point of contact. Well, okay. So I asked him if he was lead organizer and you&#8217;d not say yes. He said it was main point of contact. Was there a lead organizer? Was there one person or was it just like main point of <span>[00:32:00]</span> contact was by default?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, actually, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:32:03]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> uh, he was, yeah, actually we didn&#8217;t,  specifically any lead organizer, so, because. Actually, initially he came up with this idea, so we all communicate through him and he really, yeah, if, if you say, if you, if he can be said, who is the leader, I think it&#8217;s, we can tell it first, so, yeah, that&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, we didn&#8217;t get into that conversation, so we, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>we work as a group. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:32:33]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> All right, that makes sense. Have you, um, organized, been on an organizing team for a WordCamp before? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:32:46]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Yes, I did. So actually I was part of the two editions of WordCamp Cochin. Okay. And one edition of WordCamp Kerala we conducted last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:32:58]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So my question related <span>[00:33:00]</span> to that is, how is this different from an organizer standpoint? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:33:05]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Yeah, since this is a purely online event, so there is no interaction with people physically. So basically that was a challenge. In some way, or maybe we can say the, we can cut out a few of our teams. Like we don&#8217;t need to organize a venue or, and all things related to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So basically, yeah. So anyway, the reason we choose to go for an online event, because since it was basically a contributing photos to the photo directory, and if you do it on one day, we. May not have get enough photo contributions. So if it was a <span>[00:34:00]</span> longer event or an online event, then everyone can participate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with their own time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:34:08]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Okay. So would you say it&#8217;s easier, harder or just different?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:34:16]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> I think it&#8217;s just different. So it&#8217;s,  not an easy path. So, yeah, so, </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:34:23]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> yeah, I can imagine some parts would be easier and some parts would be harder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:34:26]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Yeah, yeah, some parts would be harder. So the organizing the talks and all the things, the interaction between the,  attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was a bit different from an in person event. So I&#8217;m not sure if we get enough,  networking experience or networking opportunities. With these online events, so Sure, yeah. That, yeah, that&#8217;s an issue. So, but the easy parties,  like I mentioned before, we don&#8217;t need to worry about the venue and the core setup for <span>[00:35:00]</span> the speakers and all sort of things related to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, that&#8217;s, that makes sense. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:35:07]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. That, yeah, that. Um, let&#8217;s talk about the future a little bit, um, specifically for a photos event, not just virtual, but specifically for a photos event, what would you do differently in the future, especially from your standpoint is as the tech guy, what would you build differently?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How would you come at it? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:35:30]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Uh, so I think,  the easiest way is to,  we can build a efficient. A system to, I mean, display the photos. So currently we have some limitations with the API, how we get the photos and display them. So sometimes it&#8217;s harder to get all the info we need in one go or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And <span>[00:36:00]</span> the other thing we might need to change is,  if we can accept more photos from a user, but that&#8217;s a Uh, I think it&#8217;s different. So if you get more photos from one person, I think it&#8217;s a bit harder to moderate. So I think the other thing, the one thing I would do differently is,  the, if we can serve first come first,  uh, maybe we can approve the photos of the person who submitted it first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe that way everyone will get a decent chance. So. Right. Something like that. So, yeah, I think, I know some of the,  photos from the users. So since the Q and the admin is random, so maybe some of the photos of, from a user will come to us to moderate regularly. So, yeah. And I think,  also in the recent update, <span>[00:37:00]</span> they fixed the sorting issue with the date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe that will help in the future. So, and the other thing,  maybe. Uh, we can,  this, this time, I think we didn&#8217;t get enough time to plan things perfectly. So yeah, we did in the short amount of time we got. And so maybe next year, if we are,  planning to do this kind of event, mostly I think prefer a hybrid kind of event, maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some if anyone can anyone wanted to attend the event in person, they can and also if it&#8217;s going to be a longer even like this, maybe at one week or something like that. So sure. Yes. Maybe the initial day we can <span>[00:38:00]</span> just gather like a regular webcam and we all have the token. Or the opportunity to do the networking and or some of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:38:08]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So, um, you mentioned more time to prepare. How much did you take? How much did you have? Just one week? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:38:17]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> I think less than two weeks. So that&#8217;s </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:38:19]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> okay. So if I wanted to do one of these myself, I should plan on three or four weeks preparation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:38:28]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Yeah, that would be perfect. So I,  the main reason is we need to prepare the site and the contents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once it&#8217;s ready, I think,  the rest is,  spread the spreading the information around the community. So what we did was we just reach out to all our friends in the community and they share the or the social media post. So that&#8217;s the, right, that&#8217;s how we get all the attendees. So we didn&#8217;t <span>[00:39:00]</span> do any like,  a promotion or social media advertisement Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or anything like that. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s mostly, I I heard that word of mouth, so yeah. That&#8217;s it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:39:11]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. That was very impressive. And it worked well. It got me, I mean, Yeah, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s why I was there. Yeah, pretty great. Okay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:39:21]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> The, the other thing we did differently is we,  translate the how to post in different local languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So, yes. So that way we will get more inclusion from different part of the region. So in India,  there is Officially 26 or 30 or something like that. Language is this standard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:39:47]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So, right. Yeah. And you personally translated all of them, right? No, no, no, no. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:39:56]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> I think I only can read one or two of the languages.<span>[00:40:00]</span> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some I can,  understand and some I can speak. So maybe only I can read and write. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:40:08]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> So, yeah. What are your main, what, what are those two that, you know, are really well? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:40:13]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Actually, my,  mother tongue is Malayalam, so. Okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, the other,  I can talk in English, so. Great, yeah. It&#8217;s not an official language in India, anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we all speak, communicate in English, since everyone knows it. The other two languages I speak, Tamil. Yeah. So it&#8217;s, yeah. That&#8217;s nearby. And the other is Hindi. Yeah, it&#8217;s nearby. Oh, yeah. And also, yeah, Hindi, so I know a little bit of Hindi. And so, and also I know some Canada or something like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:40:48]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Um, I have, I have my translation badge on wordpress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>org. I have, I have translated WordPress <span>[00:41:00]</span> into Canadian, Australian, and British. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s how far multilingual I am. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:41:13]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Okay. So, all right. So from English. Yeah. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:41:19]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Yeah. Well, thank you very much for your time. I appreciate </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:41:23]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> it. Okay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:41:24]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Um, and,  I look forward to talking to you, talking to you again. Okay. Good. Sure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:41:31]</span> <strong>Ajith:</strong> Thank you. All right. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:41:32]</span> <strong>Topher:</strong> Bye bye. And that&#8217;s our story for today. I hope you enjoyed it. Be sure to stop by tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re going to talk to some volunteers from the event and find out what it&#8217;s like to work at an event where you don&#8217;t really interact with the attendees. Or the organizers or anyone else. What&#8217;s it like to run, not just a virtual event, but a photo walk like </p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>[00:42:00]</span> this. I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 19:40:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Topher DeRosia\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Sat, 16 Mar 2024 13:11:27 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Sat, 16 Mar 2024 13:00:29 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:7:\"alt-svc\";s:19:\"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}','no');
